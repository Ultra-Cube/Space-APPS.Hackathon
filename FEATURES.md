# New Features Guide

This document describes the new features added to SpaceBio Semantic Search.

## 1. AI-Powered Summary API

### Endpoint: `POST /summarize/{pub_id}`

This new endpoint generates an AI-powered summary of any publication in the database.

**How it works:**
- Extracts key sections from the publication (abstract, results, conclusions)
- Intelligently truncates long sections while preserving meaning
- Returns a structured summary with metadata

**Example Usage:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/summarize/PMC3630201"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "pub_id": "PMC3630201",
  "title": "Publication Title",
  "authors": "Author Names",
  "year": "2013",
  "summary": "Formatted summary text with key sections",
  "full_sections": ["abstract", "introduction", "methods", "results", "discussion"]
}
```

## 2. Frontend Web Interface

### Location: `http://localhost:8000/`

A modern, user-friendly web interface for searching and exploring publications.

**Features:**

### Search Functionality
- Simple search box with Enter key support
- Adjustable result count (5, 10, 20, 50 results)
- Real-time loading indicators
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Result Display
- Card-based layout for easy scanning
- Color-coded relevance scores
- Metadata display (authors, year, section)
- Search term highlighting in excerpts
- Responsive design for all devices

### AI Summary Modal
- One-click access to AI-generated summaries
- Modal overlay for focused reading
- Loading states during API calls
- Full publication view option

### Technical Details
- Pure JavaScript (no frameworks required)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript features
- XSS protection with proper escaping
- CORS enabled for API access

## 3. Enhanced API Features

### CORS Middleware
The API now includes CORS middleware to allow frontend access from any origin. In production, you should configure specific allowed origins.

### Static File Serving
The FastAPI app automatically serves the frontend files when the `frontend/` directory exists.

## File Structure

```
frontend/
├── index.html       # Main HTML page
├── style.css        # Styling and responsive design
└── search.js        # Search logic and API integration
```

## Browser Support

The frontend works on all modern browsers:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit `frontend/style.css` and update the gradient colors:
```css
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

### Adjusting Search Behavior
Edit `frontend/search.js` and modify the `performSearch()` function.

### API Endpoint Configuration
The JavaScript automatically detects the current origin. To use a different API endpoint, change:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://your-api-server:8000';
```

## Security Considerations

1. **XSS Protection**: All user input is properly escaped before display
2. **CORS**: Configure `allow_origins` in production to specific domains
3. **Input Validation**: Search queries are validated before API calls

## Performance

- Frontend assets are minimal (~17KB total)
- No external dependencies or CDN calls
- Fast initial load time
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Optimized CSS with minimal reflows

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels where needed
- High contrast color scheme
- Responsive font sizes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Search history and bookmarks
- Advanced filtering options
- Export results to CSV/JSON
- Dark mode toggle
- PDF export of summaries
- Multi-language support
