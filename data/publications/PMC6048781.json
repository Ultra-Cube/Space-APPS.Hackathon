    "cap1/eru_is_a_pm-localized_protein": "A major result used to support the CAP1/ERU-NH\n4\n+\n homeostasis model was the observation that a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion localized to the tonoplast. According to the model, the tonoplast-localized CAP1/ERU is what senses cytoplasmic NH\n4\n+\n, resulting in its compartmentalization into the vacuole (\nBai et al., 2014\n).\nWe independently isolated the recessive \neru-3\n mutant in a forward-genetic screen for root hair mutants that resembled wild-type root hairs treated with low concentrations of the actin-disrupting compound latrunculin B. Here, we refer to our mutant as \neru-3\n following the nomenclature of \nHaruta et al. (2014)\n, in which two mutant alleles of \neru\n were first described as \neru-1\n and \neru-2\n. The \ncap1\n mutant (SALK_083442) studied by \nBai et al. (2014)\n is similar to \neru-2\n; therefore, we refer to it here as \ncap1/eru-2\n (\nFigure 1A\n). When we expressed an \nERU-GFP\n construct under the control of the constitutive \nUBIQUITIN10\n (\nUBQ10\n) promoter (\nUBQ10:ERU-GFP\n) in the \neru-3\n mutants, their root hairs were restored to wild-type lengths, indicating that the fusion protein was functional (\nFigures 1B and 1C\n).\nFigure 1.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nA Functional ERU-GFP Fusion Localizes to the PM and Post-Golgi/Endocytic Vesicles at the Root Hair Tip.\n\n\n(A)\n Schematic diagram of the domain organization of the ERU protein.

The same data were plotted in \n(E)\n and \n(F)\n. See detailed methods in supplemental data.\nWe found that instead of localizing to the root hair tonoplast, ERU-GFP marked the PM at the site of root hair bulges. As root hairs transitioned to rapid tip growth, the ERU-GFP signal intensified and formed a diffuse fluorescent cap at the root hair apex (\nFigure 1D\n). Distal to the root hair tip, ERU-GFP decorated distinct and dynamic puncta that were reminiscent of post-Golgi and endocytic vesicles (\nFigure 1D\n). As root hairs matured and ceased growth, the intensity of ERU-GFP at the tip declined (\nFigure 1D\n). Time-course and correlation analyses revealed that tip-directed accumulation of ERU-GFP was most intense in root hairs that grew rapidly (\nFigures 1E and 1F\n), supporting the role of ERU as a positive regulator of root hair tip growth.\nIt is important to note that \nBai et al. (2014)\n used transient expression of a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion in protoplasts and onion epidermal cells to conclude that it localized to the tonoplast, and the functionality of their CAP1/ERU-GFP construct was not validated in root hairs. It is possible that their CAP1/ERU-GFP was mislocalized because it was expressed in cell types (i.e., leaf protoplasts and onion epidermal cells) in which ERU is not typically found. We attempted to express ERU-GFP in the \neru-3\n mutant under the control of the native \nERU\n promoter (\nERU\npro\n) consisting of 626 bp upstream of the \nERU\n gene. Unfortunately, we were unable to recover \nERU\npro\n:ERU-GFP\n lines. However, it was recently reported that a 2529-bp sequence that included the \nERU\n promoter coupled to the \nERU\n coding and \nGFP\n sequence (\nERUp:ERU-GFP\n) complemented \ncap1/eru-2\n root hairs (\nSchoenaers et al., 2018\n). This group found that expressed ERU-GFP localized to root hairs in a similar manner as our constitutively expressed ERU-GFP, further supporting our conclusion that the PM is where the ERU protein resides.",

    "cap1/eru_function_is_linked_to_cytoplasmic_calcium_oscillati": "Another major result of \nBai et al. (2014)\n that we address in this letter is their finding that root hairs of \ncap1/eru\n loss-of-function mutants appeared to lack tip-focused [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n gradients. We feel that it is important to address these results because they provide an example of how [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n imaging data on root hairs can be misinterpreted. For these experiments, it is critical to note that root hair growth ceases when the large central vacuole protrudes toward the cell apex (\nGrierson et al., 2014\n). Furthermore, mature, nongrowing root hairs in which the vacuole protrudes to the apex have been shown to lack [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n gradients (\nWymer et al., 1997\n). The images of \ncap1/eru-2\n root hairs that \nBai et al. (2014)\n presented as the basis for extracting their [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n data (Figures 2A and 3C in \nBai et al. [2014]\n) clearly showed the vacuole protruding to the apex. Based on the above observations, we would not expect to find [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n gradients in such root hairs. We expressed the intensiometric [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n reporter G-CAMP3 (\nTian et al., 2009\n) in \neru-3\n to assess if their root hairs lacked a [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n gradient. We were careful to sample [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n only in root hairs that had a dense cytoplasm at the cell apex.\nIn contrast to the results of \nBai et al. (2014)\n, we found that \neru-3\n root hairs that still had a substantial cytoplasm at the apex did not lack tip-focused [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n gradients. These \neru-3\n root hairs were still elongating, albeit at a significantly reduced rate when compared with the wild type (∼0.20 μm/min for \neru-3\n versus 1 μm/min for the wild type). However, we did observe that patterns of tip [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n oscillations in these slow growing \neru-3\n root hairs were compromised. Compared with the wild type, root hairs of \neru-3\n had more prolonged periods of elevated tip-focused [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n followed by longer periods of dampened [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n (\nFigures 2A to 2C\n; \nSupplemental Movie 1\n). Quantitative analysis of [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n following the fast Fourier transform methods described by \nSchoenaers et al. (2018)\n showed that \neru-3\n displayed low frequency [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n oscillations. The main frequency of [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n oscillations in \neru-3\n root hairs was 0.003 ± 0.0002 Hz compared with 0.044 ± 0.0184 Hz in the wild type (\nFigure 2D\n). Furthermore, the amplitude of [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n oscillation at the tips of \neru-3\n was ∼3-fold higher than the wild type (\nFigure 2E\n). These results are in agreement with findings of \nSchoenaers et al. (2018)\n in which they showed decreased frequency and increased amplitude of pectin Ca\n2+\n binding site oscillations in \ncap1/eru-2\n root hairs. It is clear from our results that ERU is important for normal tip-focused [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n oscillations, a process that is crucial for sustained root hair growth (\nMonshausen et al., 2008\n). Mechanistic links between PM-localized ERU and the maintenance of [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n oscillations are unknown. However, demonstrating the true nature of tip-focused [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n defects in \neru-3\n root hairs enables the development of more accurate models that could be tested in the future to explain how ERU modulates tip growth.\nFigure 2.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nERU Functions in Maintaining Normal Tip-Focused [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n in Root Hairs.\n\n\n(A)\n Representative heat maps of the root hair apex and normalized oscillograms of one wild-type and two \neru-3\n mutants.

See detailed methods in supplemental data.\nIn light of the ERU localization data presented here and those reported by \nSchoenaers et al. (2018)\n, the model by \nBai et al. (2014)\n, proposing that tonoplast-based NH\n4\n+\n signaling is the major driver for ERU-mediated tip-focused [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n oscillations and root hair growth, needs reexamination. Other CrRLK1Ls, such as FER, THESEUS1, HERCULES1, ANXUR, and BUDDHA’s PAPER SEAL, have all been shown to localize to the PM (\nEscobar-Restrepo et al., 2007\n; \nHématy et al., 2007\n; \nBoisson-Dernier et al., 2009\n; \nGuo et al., 2009\n; \nMiyazaki et al., 2009\n; \nDuan et al., 2010\n; \nGe et al., 2017\n). Our results and those of \nSchoenaers et al. (2018)\n clearly demonstrate that ERU is also a PM-localized CrRLK1L and should no longer be referred to as a vacuolar membrane-localized protein.",
