    "abstract": "Xyloglucan is a polysaccharide that has important roles in the formation and function of the walls that surround growing land plant cells. Many of these plants synthesize xyloglucan that contains galactose in two different side chains (L and F), which exist in distinct molecular environments. However, little is known about the contribution of these side chains to xyloglucan function. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n) mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 (MUR3) form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated xylose than its wild-type counterpart. The galactose-depleted xyloglucan is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that are dwarfed with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, and short inflorescence stems. Moreover, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectin, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. Near-normal growth is restored by generating \nmur3\n mutants that produce no detectable amounts of xyloglucan. Thus, cellular processes are affected more by the presence of the dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating xyloglucan altogether. To identify structural features responsible for xyloglucan dysfunction, xyloglucan structure was modified in situ by generating \nmur3\n mutants that lack specific xyloglucan xylosyltransferases (XXTs) or that overexpress the \nXYLOGLUCAN L-SIDE CHAIN GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE2\n (\nXLT2\n) gene. Normal growth was restored in the \nmur3-3\n mutant overexpressing \nXLT2\n and in \nmur3-3 xxt\n double mutants when the dysfunctional xyloglucan was modified by doubling the amounts of galactosylated side chains. Our study assigns a role for galactosylation in normal xyloglucan function and demonstrates that altering xyloglucan side chain structure disturbs diverse cellular and physiological processes.",

    "results_and_discussion": "Reducing \nXyG\n to below Detectable Levels Suppresses the Dwarf Phenotype of \nmur3-3\n Plants\n\n\nMUR3\n encodes an \nXyG\n-specific galactosyltransferase responsible for most of the galactosylation of Arabidopsis \nXyG\n. To address the possibility that altered \nXyG\n structure leads to the phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants lacking functional MUR3, we took a genetic approach to reduce the amounts of \nXyG\n to undetectable levels in the \nmur3-3\n mutant. Thus, we crossed \nmur3-3\n with the \nxxt1 xxt2\n double mutant, which has no detectable amounts of \nXyG\n in its cell wall (\nCavalier et al., 2008\n; \nZabotina et al., 2012\n). The \nxxt1 xxt2\n mutant grows somewhat more slowly than wild-type plants but does not have a cabbage-like phenotype (\nCavalier et al., 2008\n) or abnormal endomembrane aggregates (\nUehara et al., 2014\n), making it visibly distinct from the \nmur3-3\n mutant (\nFig. 1C\n).\n\n\nThe \nxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3\n triple mutant, which produces no discernible \nXXT1\n, \nXXT2\n, or \nMUR3\n transcripts (\nSupplemental Fig. S1A\n), does not have a cabbage-like phenotype and is visibly indistinguishable from the \nxxt1 xxt2\n mutant (\nFig. 1C\n). Toluidine blue-stained cross sections of wild-type, \nxxt1 xxt2\n, and \nxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3\n leaves are also visibly similar (\nFig. 1E\n). Most of the \nmur3-3\n cells are smaller than their wild-type counterparts, a result that is in agreement with the proposal that these cells have lost the ability to expand normally (\nTamura et al., 2005\n). Glycome profiling (\nFig. 1D\n) and immunocytochemistry (\nFig. 1E\n) indicate that the \nXyG\n present in \nmur3-3\n walls is not fucosylated, whereas wild-type walls contain fucosylated \nXyG\n. No discernible amounts of \nXyG\n were detected in \nxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3\n leaf cell walls (\nFig. 1, D and E\n), nor were xyloglucan oligosaccharides (\nXyGO\ns) detected after \nXyG\n-specific endoglucanase (\nXEG\n) treatment of the 1 and 4 \nn\n KOH-soluble materials from \nxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3\n root, leaf, and stem cell walls. Thus, the presence of \nXyG\n is strongly correlated with the cabbage-like phenotype of the \nmur3-3\n mutant. Our data suggest that the absence of the MUR3 galactosyltransferase leads to the formation of dysfunctional \nXyG\n, and that cellular processes are affected more by the presence of this dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating \nXyG\n altogether.\nThe \nmur3-1\n, \nmur3-2, mur3-3\n, and \nmur3-7\n Phenotypes Are Associated with Altered \nXyG\n Chemotypes\n\n\nSince the presence of dysfunctional \nXyG\n is correlated with the cabbage-like phenotype of \nmur3-3\n plants, we next determined the structural features of \nXyG\n that are associated with this phenotype. To this end, the \nXyG\ns from \nmur3-1\n, \nmur3-2\n, \nmur3-3\n, and \nmur3-7\n, each of which carries a different mutation in \nMUR3\n (\nSupplemental Fig. S1B\n), were structurally characterized. The structures of these \nXyG\ns have not previously been compared, since only the distinguishing chemical structures of the \nmur3-1\n\n\nXyG\n have been described (\nMadson et al., 2003\n; \nPeña et al., 2004\n). Here, the \nXyGO\ns generated by \nXEG\n fragmentation of leaf \nXyG\n obtained from each mutant grown at 19°C (\nFig. 2\n) were characterized using \n1\nH-NMR spectroscopy (\nHoffman et al., 2005\n), matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight (\nMALDI-TOF\n) mass spectrometry (\nMS\n), and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (\nHPAEC\n) with pulsed-amperometric detection (\nPAD\n; \nTuomivaara et al., 2015\n).\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nThe phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the xyloglucan-specific galactosyltransferases MUR3 and XLT2. Plants were grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle or with a 14-h-light (28°C) and 10-h-dark (24°C) cycle. Images were taken when the plants were 4 weeks old.\nHomozygous \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n plants, respectively, carry a transfer DNA insertion in the region encoding the exostosin-like domain and the protein’s N terminus (\nTedman-Jones et al., 2008\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S1B\n). Both mutants produce no detectable \nMUR3\n transcripts (\nSupplemental Fig. S1A\n) and have a cabbage-like phenotype when grown at 19°C in soil (\nFig. 2\n). These mutants are visibly distinct from the \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n mutants (\nFig. 2\n), both of which produce detectable amounts of the MUR3 protein (\nTamura et al., 2005\n).\n\n\nThe \n1\nH-NMR spectrum of the \nmur3-3\n\n\nXyGO\ns contained no discernible signals corresponding to an F side chain at any position or to an L side chain adjacent to the unbranched Glc residue (\nFig. 3\n; \nSupplemental Table S1\n). \nMALDI-TOF\n\n\nMS\n and \nHPAEC\n-\nPAD\n confirmed that the \nmur3-3\n\n\nXyG\n is composed entirely of XXXG (63%) and XLXG (37%) subunits (\nFig. 4A\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S2, A and B\n). The \nmur3-7\n\n\nXyG\n is also composed of XXXG (73%) and XLXG (27%) subunits (\nFig. 4A\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S3\n). Overexpressing \nMUR3\n under the control of a 35S promoter in the \nmur3-3\n mutant rescued the cabbage-like phenotype (\nSupplemental Fig. S4\n) and led to the synthesis of \nXyG\n containing near wild-type levels of XXFG and XLFG subunits (\nFig. 4A\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S3\n). These analyses are in agreement with previous studies showing that MUR3 is a regiospecific galactosyltransferase that adds a Gal residue to the Xyl adjacent to the unbranched Glc in the \nXyG\n backbone (\nMadson et al., 2003\n; \nPeña et al., 2004\n).\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nPartial 600-MHz \n1\nH-NMR spectra of the \nXyG\n oligosaccharides generated by \nXEG\n treatment of the 4 \nn\n KOH-soluble \nXyG\n from wild-type (\nCol-0\n), \nmur3-1\n, \nmur3-2\n, and \nmur3-3\n leaf cell walls. Plants were grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle. The residues corresponding to each group of proton resonances (e.g. 2-Xyl) are indicated at the top of the wild-type spectrum. The location of these residues in a side chain (X, L, or F) is indicated.\nFigure 4.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nThe amounts and subunit compositions of the xyloglucan present in the leaf cell walls of wild-type and selected \nmur3\n mutant plants. A and B, The subunit compositions of \nXyG\n present in wild-type and mutant leaves. \nXyG\n oligosaccharides were generated by \nXEG\n treatment of the 4 \nn\n KOH-soluble materials from at least three individual plants and analyzed by \nMALDI-TOF\n\n\nMS\n. \nHPAEC\n-\nPAD\n (\nSupplemental Fig. S2\n) and \n1\nH-NMR analyses (\nSupplemental Table S1\n) indicated that XXLG and XLLG account for between 6% and 9% of the subunits in \nCol-0\n and \n35S\npro\nMUR3\n:\nmur3-3\n\n\nXyG\n. These subunits were not detected in any of the other plants. C, The amounts of Driselase-susceptible \nXyG\n in wild-type and mutant leaves determined from the amounts of isoprimeverose released by Driselase treatment of the cell walls.\nIn contrast to \nmur3-3\n, the \n1\nH-NMR spectra of the \nXyGO\ns generated from \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n\n\nXyG\n contained low-intensity signals diagnostic of F side chains (\nFig. 3\n; \nSupplemental Table S1\n). Subunits containing F side chains were also discernible in the \nMALDI-TOF\n\n\nMS\n and \nHPAEC\n-\nPAD\n profiles of the \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n\n\nXyGO\ns (\nFig. 4A\n; \nSupplemental Figs. S2 and S4\n). Moreover, the \nMALDI-TOF\n\n\nMS\n of the \nXyGO\n subunits generated by \nXEG\n treatment of \nmur3-1\n and \nmur 3-2\n cell walls contained low-intensity ions corresponding to mono \nO\n-acetylated XXFG and XLFG subunits (\nSupplemental Fig. S5\n). No \nO\n-acetylated \nXyG\n subunits were generated by \nXEG\n treatment of \nmur3-3\n cell walls (\nSupplemental Fig. S5\n). Such results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that the F side chain Gal accounts for the bulk of the \nO\n-acetylated glycoses in Arabidopsis leaf \nXyG\n (\nPauly et al., 2001\n; \nPerrin et al., 2003\n). Our NMR data indicate that \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n\n\nXyG\ns contain approximately 7% and 14%, respectively, of the F side chain present in wild-type plants (\nSupplemental Table S1\n) and are consistent with the results of recent studies indicating that small amounts of the F side chain are present in the xyloglucan isolated from the \nmur3-1\n mutant (\nJensen et al., 2012\n; \nSchultink et al., 2013\n; \nVinueza et al., 2013\n).\n\n\nOur data show that the S470L amino acid substitution in \nmur3-1\n has a more severe effect on xyloglucan galactosylation than the A290V substitution in \nmur3-2\n. Indeed, the \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n mutants are not identical, since the etiolated hypocotyls of \nmur3-1\n are approximately 50% shorter than their \nmur3-2\n counterparts (\nSupplemental Fig. S6\n). \nLi et al. (2013)\n have reported that the roots of the \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n plants are somewhat less sensitive to salt stress than their \nrsa3-1\n and \nkam1-3\n counterparts and concluded that RSA3/MUR3/KAM1 is important in the salt stress tolerance pathway. We extend this notion by proposing that the phenotype of each \nmur3\n mutant is determined in large part by the extent of residual xyloglucan galactosylation at the MUR3-specific position.\nXyloglucan Side Chain Extension Is Increased and the Cabbage-Like Phenotype of \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n Plants Is Suppressed by Overexpression of XLT2\n\n\nOur results indicated that reduced extension of \nXyG\n side chains is correlated with the cabbage-like phenotype of \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n plants. To determine if this is the case, we overexpressed \nXLT2\n in the \nmur3-3\n mutant (see \nSupplemental Fig. S7\n). The 35S\npro\n:\nXLT2\n:\nmur3-3\n plants (36 independent transgenic lines identified) are visibly indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts (\nFig. 5\n) and produce \nXyG\n containing less than 15% XXXG (\nFig. 4B\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S4\n). Comparable results were obtained when \nXLT2\n was overexpressed in \nmur3-7\n plants. The ability of overexpressed XLT2 to significantly decrease the XXXG content of the \nXyG\n while suppressing the cabbage-like phenotype is again consistent with the notion that this phenotype is correlated with the presence of dysfunctional \nXyG\n. Indeed, the mild dwarf phenotype of the \nxlt2 mur3-1\n mutant is also rescued by extending the \nXyG\n side chains with arabinofuranosyl residues (\nSchultink et al., 2013\n). Such data provide further evidence that \nXyG\n deficient in extended side chains is dysfunctional, and that the synthesis of dysfunctional \nXyG\n leads to abnormal growth.\n\n\nFigure 5.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nThe phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the xyloglucan-specific galactosyltransferases MUR3 or the xylosyltransferases XXT1, XXT2, and XXT5.

Images were taken when the plants were 4 weeks old.\nThe Phenotypes of \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n Plants Are Suppressed by Knocking out \nXXT2\n or \nXXT5\n\n\n\n\nPlants that had a wild-type phenotype, yet were genotyped as \nXXT1 xxt2 mur3-3,\n were obtained during the generation of the \nxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3\n triple mutant, which led us to suspect that abolishing the expression of specific \nXXT\n genes suppressed the cabbage-like phenotype. To obtain experimental support for this hypothesis, we generated a series of double mutants by crossing \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n with the \nxxt1, xxt2, and xxt5\n mutants (see \nFig. 5\n), which themselves have wild-type phenotypes (\nCavalier et al., 2008\n; \nVuttipongchaikij et al., 2012\n; \nZabotina et al., 2012\n).\n\n\nThe \nxxt2-1 mur3-3, xxt2-2 mur3-7\n, \nxxt5 mur3-3\n, and \nxxt5 mur3-7\n mutants were phenotypically comparable with wild-type plants (\nFig. 4\n). The walls of these four double mutants contain 35% to 50% less Driselase-susceptible \nXyG\n than the walls of the \nxxt1 mur3-3\n, \nmur3-3\n, and \nmur3-7\n mutants (\nFig. 4C\n; \nSupplemental Table S2\n). Notably, XLXG subunits accounted for at least 59% of the \nXyG\n in the normal-looking \nxxt2-1 mur3-3, xxt2-2 mur3-7\n, \nxxt5 mur3-3\n, and \nxxt5 mur3-7\n mutant plants (\nFig. 4B\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S4\n). By contrast, the XLXG subunit accounts for 44% of the \nXyG\n from the \nxxt1 mur3-3\n double mutant (\nFig. 4B\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S3\n), which retained the cabbage-like phenotype (\nFig. 5\n). Such data are again consistent with the notion that this phenotype is a consequence of the synthesis of \nXyG\n deficient in extended side chains.\n\n\nTamura et al. (2005)\n have proposed that the cabbage-like phenotype of \nkam1\n/\nmur3\n mutant plants is a consequence of abnormal endomembrane organization resulting from the absence of the MUR3 protein. However, the endomembrane aggregation phenotype observed in \nmur3-3\n plants was largely suppressed in the \nxxt2-1 mur3-3\n and \nxxt5 mur3-3\n mutant plants (\nFig. 6A\n) but not in the \nxxt1 mur3-3\n mutant. Our data are thus consistent with the notion that \nXyG\n with a high proportion of unsubstituted XXXG subunits is dysfunctional, and that its presence, rather than the absence of a functional MUR3 protein, is strongly correlated with the presence of endomembrane aggregates. Swollen epidermal cells with endomembrane aggregates have been observed in the roots of plants lacking an isoform of UDP-Glc 4-epimerase (\nuge4\n; \nUehara et al., 2014\n). The \nuge4\n root \nXyG\n contains approximately 50% less Gal than wild-type \nXyG\n (\nNguema-Ona et al., 2006\n; \nRösti et al., 2007\n). Membrane aggregation and cell bulging were suppressed by growing \nuge4\n in the presence of Gal, which led to the suggestion that reduced galactosylation of \nXyG\n or arabinogalactan protein is responsible for endomembrane disorganization (\nUehara et al., 2014\n). Nevertheless, a direct causal relationship between endomembrane aggregation and plant growth is unlikely, as Arabidopsis plants carrying a mutation in the coat promoter complex II coat protein SECRETORY 24A have endomembrane aggregates comparable to \nmur3-3\n but are not dwarfed (\nFaso et al., 2009\n).\n\n\nFigure 6.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nEndomembrane aggregation and intracellular accumulation of cell wall polysaccharides in \nmur3-3\n plants. A, Endomembrane aggregation in \nmur3-3\n plants is suppressed by knocking out \nXXT2\n or \nXXT5\n. \nCol-0\n (wild-type [WT]) and mutant plants were individually transformed with the SP-2SC-GFP (for signal peptide of pumpkin 2S albumin followed by a linker of GGG and the C-terminal 18-amino acid sequence of pumpkin 2S albumin) construct and grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle or a 14-h-light (28°C) and 10-h-dark (24°C) cycle. Images of epidermal cells of 14-d-old cotyledons expressing the endomembrane-targeted SP-2SC-GFP were obtained using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. Bar = 10 µm. B, Immunocytochemistry reveals intracellular aggregates (see arrows) containing \nXyG\n and pectin in \nmur3\n hypocotyls. Top, Toluidine blue-stained cross sections. CCRC-M88 recognizes \nXyG\n, CCRC-M1 recognizes fucosylated \nXyG\n, and CCRC-M38 recognizes deesterified homogalacturonan. Bar = 50 µm.\nIntracellular Aggregates Containing Xyloglucan and Pectin Accumulate in the Cells of \nmur3-3\n Hypocotyls\n\n\nPectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides are believed to be synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and are then transferred from the trans-Golgi network in vesicles that move to and fuse with the plasma membrane (\nBashline et al., 2014\n). The polysaccharides are then released into the apoplast and incorporated into the existing cell wall. Defects in trans-Golgi network-dependent secretion of polysaccharides in the \nechidna\n mutant have been shown to result in the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing pectin and xyloglucan (\nGendre et al., 2013\n). Thus, we examined polysaccharide secretion in \nmur3-3\n, as its cells contain abnormal endomembrane aggregates (\nFig. 6A\n). Intracellular aggregates were clearly visible in the epidermal cells of a toluidine blue-stained cross section of the \nmur3-3\n hypocotyl (\nFig. 6B\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S8A\n). Smaller amounts of aggregates were also visible in \nmur3-1\n hypocotyls (\nFig. 6B\n). These aggregates were labeled with monoclonal antibodies that recognize xyloglucan and deesterified homogalacturonan (\nFig. 6B\n). Few, if any, aggregates were discernible in \nmur3-2,\n wild-type (\nFig. 6B\n), or \n35S\npro\nMUR3:mur3-3\n hypocotyls (\nSupplemental Fig. S8B\n). Taken together, these data provide evidence that, in \nmur3-3\n hypocotyls and to a lesser extent in \nmur3-1\n hypocotyls, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectins, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. These data again support the notion that the phenotype of each \nmur3\n mutant is determined in large part by the amount of catalytically functional MUR3 protein it produces.\nTemperature Affects the Growth of \nmur3\n Plants and the Catalytic Activity of the Mutated MUR3 Protein\n\n\nEarly studies reported that \nmur3-1\n\n\nXyG\n lacks F side chains (\nMadson et al., 2003\n; \nPeña et al., 2004\n), although subsequent analyses indicated that fucosylated subunits account for up to 5% of the \nmur3-1\n and \nxlt2 mur3-1\n\n\nXyG\ns (\nJensen et al., 2012\n; \nSchultink et al., 2013\n; \nVinueza et al., 2013\n). Nevertheless, those values are lower than the values we obtained (\nFig. 4A\n). As our plants were grown at 19°C rather than at 22°C or 26°C as in the earlier studies, we determined whether temperature affects the extent of \nXyG\n fucosylation or plant growth.\n\n\nThere was an approximately 85% decrease in the relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits in the \nXyG\n from \nmur3-1\n and \nxlt2 mur3-1\n plants grown at 28°C (\nFig. 7, A and B\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S9\n). \nxlt2 mur3-1\n mutants grown at 19°C or 28°C do not have a severe cabbage-like phenotype but do have short petioles and slightly curved leaves, making them visibly distinct from wild-type plants (\nFig. 2\n). The relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits in \nmur3-2\n\n\nXyG\n was comparable at both growth temperatures (\nFig. 7\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S9\n). These data confirm that \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n plants retain a residual amount of MUR3 activity and show that, in plants with the allelic (S470L) MUR3-1 protein, \nXyG\n galactosylation at the MUR3 position is diminished by increasing growth temperature.\n\n\nFigure 7.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nThe effect of growth temperature on the xyloglucan subunit compositions of selected \nmur3\n and wild-type plants. A, \nXyG\n subunit compositions of plants grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle. B, \nXyG\n subunit compositions of plants grown with a 14-h-light (28°C) and 10-h-dark (24°C) cycle. \nXyG\n oligosaccharides were generated by \nXEG\n treatment of the 4 \nn\n KOH-soluble materials from at least three individual plants and analyzed by \nMALDI-TOF\n\n\nMS\n. \nHPAEC\n-\nPAD\n analyses indicated that XXLG and XLLG accounted for approximately 6% of the subunits in \nCol-0\n\n\nXyG\n (see \nSupplemental Fig. S9\n).\nSomewhat surprisingly, the cabbage-like phenotype is suppressed when \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n plants are grown at 28°C (\nFig. 2\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S10\n), even though the cell walls of the mutants still contain \nXyG\n, in which the XXXG subunit predominates (\nFig. 7B\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S9\n), and the endomembrane aggregates still exist (\nFig. 6A\n). That \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n exhibit near-normal growth at 28°C is consistent with the temperature-dependent changes in the rheological properties of Gal-depleted \nXyG\n (\nShirakawa et al., 1998\n). Alternatively, the protective mechanisms activated in plants in response to heat stress (\nBita and Gerats, 2013\n) may suppress the effects of the dysfunctional \nmur3-3\n\n\nXyG\n. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which elevated temperature suppresses the cabbage-like phenotype remain to be determined. It may well be the case that this phenotype results from an accumulation of temperature- and \nXyG\n structure-dependent modifications that affect both cell wall structure and remodeling and endomembrane organization.\nDysfunctional Xyloglucan and Plant Growth\n\n\nOur data show that the extent of side chain galactosylation in \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n\n\nXyG\n is reduced by approximately 70% compared with the wild type. A probability analysis (see \nSupplemental Protocol S1\n) using the XXXG subunit abundance in the \nXyG\n from \nmur3-3\n (63%), \nmur3-7\n (73%), the wild type (25%), \nmur3-1\n (48%), \nmur3-2\n (47%), and \n35S\npro\nMUR3\n:\nmur3-3\n (29%) plants predicts that domains consisting of five or more tandemly repeated XXXG sequences comprise a much higher proportion of the \nXyG\n in \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n plants than in \nXyG\n from the other plants (\nSupplemental Fig. S11\n). The existence of large tandemly repeated XXXG domains may lead to the aggregation or otherwise aberrant interactions of \nXyG\n with itself and/or with other wall polymers (\nShirakawa et al., 1998\n; \nWhitney et al., 2006\n; \nde Freitas et al., 2011\n). Such interactions together with the inability to extend the side chain adjacent to the unbranched Glc appear to be major factors in the dysfunctional properties of the \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n\n\nXyG\n and the cabbage-like phenotype of these plants. The aggregation of the nascent \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n\n\nXyG\ns may prevent the normal movement of \nXyG\n through the Golgi and the packaging of \nXyG\n in vesicles for delivery to the apoplast, and may also account for the abnormal membrane organization and the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing wall polysaccharides in \nmur3-3\n plants.\n\n\nThe differences in subunit composition of the \nmur3-3\n and \nxlt2 mur3-1\n\n\nXyG\ns (\nFig. 7\n) indicate that failure to extend the side chains next to the unbranched Glc is especially detrimental to \nXyG\n function and to plant growth. Most, if not all, of the galactosyl residues adjacent to the unbranched Glc are further extended with Fuc in the \nXyG\n present in the wall of \nxlt2 mur3-1\n plants. Although \nXyG\n fucosylation is not in itself required for the normal growth of laboratory-grown Arabidopsis plants (\nVanzin et al., 2002\n), there is evidence that fucosylation does have a role, albeit less than galactosylation, in the formation of \nXyG\n-cellulose composites (\nWhitney et al., 2006\n).\n\n\nDysfunctional xyloglucan may disrupt wall remodeling that is required for plant cells to expand and grow (\nPeña et al., 2004\n; \nPark and Cosgrove, 2012a\n, \n2012b\n). For example, the results of in vitro studies suggest that the decreased solubility of Gal-depleted \nXyG\n reduces its accessibility to the action of \nXyG\n endotransglucosylases/hydrolases (XTHs) that are believed to be involved in wall remodeling during cell growth (\nPeña et al., 2004\n). \nLi et al. (2013)\n have reported that the expression of XTH18 is increased 2-fold in \nrsa3-1\n. Thus, the cabbage-like phenotype may result at least in part from the reduced susceptibilities of the \nXyG\n to XTH. These authors also reported a 12-fold increase in the expression of the gene encoding the wall-associated kinase WAK1 (\nLi et al., 2013\n). Since WAKs are likely involved in wall sensing, cell expansion, and responses to pathogens and environmental signals (\nKohorn and Kohorn, 2012\n), they may have a role in communicating changes in wall properties to the cells of the \nmur3\n mutants.\n\n\nOur data favor a model that invokes a dysfunctional xyloglucan structure as the most direct cause of the growth defects of plants carrying loss-of-function mutations in \nMUR3\n. Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be discounted that other cellular mechanisms are responsible. For example, the phenotypes observed in plants lacking the MUR3 protein may be a consequence of an \nXyG\n biosynthesis complex (\nChou et al., 2015\n; \nLund et al., 2015\n) that becomes dysfunctional when no MUR3 protein is present. In this scenario, the \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n mutants are not cabbage like because the residual MUR3 may still be capable of forming a nondysfunctional \nXyG\n biosynthetic complex. However, to be consistent with our data, XLT2, which has 42% amino acid sequence identity with MUR3, must be able to substitute for MUR3 to form a nondysfunctional complex when \nXLT2\n is expressed at sufficiently high levels. \nXLT2\n does not replace \nMUR3\n when expressed at normal levels. This model also requires that the direct effects of the putative dysfunctional biosynthetic complex are suppressed by eliminating the XXT2 or the XXT5 protein in \nmur3-3\n or \nmur3-7\n plants. The \nxxt2 mur3-3\n and \nxxt5 mur3-3\n double mutants have near wild-type morphology and produce xyloglucan with less than 50% unsubstituted XXXG. Models that invoke a dysfunctional biosynthetic complex as the direct cause of the \nmur3-3\n phenotypes are thus complicated by several difficult-to-reconcile requirements.",
    "reducing_xyg_to_below_detectable_levels_suppresses_the_dwarf": "MUR3\n encodes an \nXyG\n-specific galactosyltransferase responsible for most of the galactosylation of Arabidopsis \nXyG\n. To address the possibility that altered \nXyG\n structure leads to the phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants lacking functional MUR3, we took a genetic approach to reduce the amounts of \nXyG\n to undetectable levels in the \nmur3-3\n mutant. Thus, we crossed \nmur3-3\n with the \nxxt1 xxt2\n double mutant, which has no detectable amounts of \nXyG\n in its cell wall (\nCavalier et al., 2008\n; \nZabotina et al., 2012\n). The \nxxt1 xxt2\n mutant grows somewhat more slowly than wild-type plants but does not have a cabbage-like phenotype (\nCavalier et al., 2008\n) or abnormal endomembrane aggregates (\nUehara et al., 2014\n), making it visibly distinct from the \nmur3-3\n mutant (\nFig. 1C\n).\nThe \nxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3\n triple mutant, which produces no discernible \nXXT1\n, \nXXT2\n, or \nMUR3\n transcripts (\nSupplemental Fig. S1A\n), does not have a cabbage-like phenotype and is visibly indistinguishable from the \nxxt1 xxt2\n mutant (\nFig. 1C\n). Toluidine blue-stained cross sections of wild-type, \nxxt1 xxt2\n, and \nxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3\n leaves are also visibly similar (\nFig. 1E\n). Most of the \nmur3-3\n cells are smaller than their wild-type counterparts, a result that is in agreement with the proposal that these cells have lost the ability to expand normally (\nTamura et al., 2005\n). Glycome profiling (\nFig. 1D\n) and immunocytochemistry (\nFig. 1E\n) indicate that the \nXyG\n present in \nmur3-3\n walls is not fucosylated, whereas wild-type walls contain fucosylated \nXyG\n. No discernible amounts of \nXyG\n were detected in \nxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3\n leaf cell walls (\nFig. 1, D and E\n), nor were xyloglucan oligosaccharides (\nXyGO\ns) detected after \nXyG\n-specific endoglucanase (\nXEG\n) treatment of the 1 and 4 \nn\n KOH-soluble materials from \nxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3\n root, leaf, and stem cell walls. Thus, the presence of \nXyG\n is strongly correlated with the cabbage-like phenotype of the \nmur3-3\n mutant. Our data suggest that the absence of the MUR3 galactosyltransferase leads to the formation of dysfunctional \nXyG\n, and that cellular processes are affected more by the presence of this dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating \nXyG\n altogether.",

Both mutants produce no detectable \nMUR3\n transcripts (\nSupplemental Fig. S1A\n) and have a cabbage-like phenotype when grown at 19°C in soil (\nFig. 2\n).

These analyses are in agreement with previous studies showing that MUR3 is a regiospecific galactosyltransferase that adds a Gal residue to the Xyl adjacent to the unbranched Glc in the \nXyG\n backbone (\nMadson et al., 2003\n; \nPeña et al., 2004\n).\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nPartial 600-MHz \n1\nH-NMR spectra of the \nXyG\n oligosaccharides generated by \nXEG\n treatment of the 4 \nn\n KOH-soluble \nXyG\n from wild-type (\nCol-0\n), \nmur3-1\n, \nmur3-2\n, and \nmur3-3\n leaf cell walls.

No \nO\n-acetylated \nXyG\n subunits were generated by \nXEG\n treatment of \nmur3-3\n cell walls (\nSupplemental Fig. S5\n). Such results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that the F side chain Gal accounts for the bulk of the \nO\n-acetylated glycoses in Arabidopsis leaf \nXyG\n (\nPauly et al., 2001\n; \nPerrin et al., 2003\n). Our NMR data indicate that \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n\n\nXyG\ns contain approximately 7% and 14%, respectively, of the F side chain present in wild-type plants (\nSupplemental Table S1\n) and are consistent with the results of recent studies indicating that small amounts of the F side chain are present in the xyloglucan isolated from the \nmur3-1\n mutant (\nJensen et al., 2012\n; \nSchultink et al., 2013\n; \nVinueza et al., 2013\n).\nOur data show that the S470L amino acid substitution in \nmur3-1\n has a more severe effect on xyloglucan galactosylation than the A290V substitution in \nmur3-2\n. Indeed, the \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n mutants are not identical, since the etiolated hypocotyls of \nmur3-1\n are approximately 50% shorter than their \nmur3-2\n counterparts (\nSupplemental Fig. S6\n). \nLi et al.

We extend this notion by proposing that the phenotype of each \nmur3\n mutant is determined in large part by the extent of residual xyloglucan galactosylation at the MUR3-specific position.",

To determine if this is the case, we overexpressed \nXLT2\n in the \nmur3-3\n mutant (see \nSupplemental Fig. S7\n). The 35S\npro\n:\nXLT2\n:\nmur3-3\n plants (36 independent transgenic lines identified) are visibly indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts (\nFig. 5\n) and produce \nXyG\n containing less than 15% XXXG (\nFig. 4B\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S4\n). Comparable results were obtained when \nXLT2\n was overexpressed in \nmur3-7\n plants. The ability of overexpressed XLT2 to significantly decrease the XXXG content of the \nXyG\n while suppressing the cabbage-like phenotype is again consistent with the notion that this phenotype is correlated with the presence of dysfunctional \nXyG\n. Indeed, the mild dwarf phenotype of the \nxlt2 mur3-1\n mutant is also rescued by extending the \nXyG\n side chains with arabinofuranosyl residues (\nSchultink et al., 2013\n). Such data provide further evidence that \nXyG\n deficient in extended side chains is dysfunctional, and that the synthesis of dysfunctional \nXyG\n leads to abnormal growth.\nFigure 5.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nThe phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the xyloglucan-specific galactosyltransferases MUR3 or the xylosyltransferases XXT1, XXT2, and XXT5.

    "the_phenotypes_of_mur3-3_and_mur3-7_plants_are_suppressed_by": "Plants that had a wild-type phenotype, yet were genotyped as \nXXT1 xxt2 mur3-3,\n were obtained during the generation of the \nxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3\n triple mutant, which led us to suspect that abolishing the expression of specific \nXXT\n genes suppressed the cabbage-like phenotype. To obtain experimental support for this hypothesis, we generated a series of double mutants by crossing \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n with the \nxxt1, xxt2, and xxt5\n mutants (see \nFig. 5\n), which themselves have wild-type phenotypes (\nCavalier et al., 2008\n; \nVuttipongchaikij et al., 2012\n; \nZabotina et al., 2012\n).\nThe \nxxt2-1 mur3-3, xxt2-2 mur3-7\n, \nxxt5 mur3-3\n, and \nxxt5 mur3-7\n mutants were phenotypically comparable with wild-type plants (\nFig. 4\n). The walls of these four double mutants contain 35% to 50% less Driselase-susceptible \nXyG\n than the walls of the \nxxt1 mur3-3\n, \nmur3-3\n, and \nmur3-7\n mutants (\nFig. 4C\n; \nSupplemental Table S2\n). Notably, XLXG subunits accounted for at least 59% of the \nXyG\n in the normal-looking \nxxt2-1 mur3-3, xxt2-2 mur3-7\n, \nxxt5 mur3-3\n, and \nxxt5 mur3-7\n mutant plants (\nFig. 4B\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S4\n). By contrast, the XLXG subunit accounts for 44% of the \nXyG\n from the \nxxt1 mur3-3\n double mutant (\nFig. 4B\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S3\n), which retained the cabbage-like phenotype (\nFig. 5\n). Such data are again consistent with the notion that this phenotype is a consequence of the synthesis of \nXyG\n deficient in extended side chains.\nTamura et al. (2005)\n have proposed that the cabbage-like phenotype of \nkam1\n/\nmur3\n mutant plants is a consequence of abnormal endomembrane organization resulting from the absence of the MUR3 protein. However, the endomembrane aggregation phenotype observed in \nmur3-3\n plants was largely suppressed in the \nxxt2-1 mur3-3\n and \nxxt5 mur3-3\n mutant plants (\nFig. 6A\n) but not in the \nxxt1 mur3-3\n mutant. Our data are thus consistent with the notion that \nXyG\n with a high proportion of unsubstituted XXXG subunits is dysfunctional, and that its presence, rather than the absence of a functional MUR3 protein, is strongly correlated with the presence of endomembrane aggregates. Swollen epidermal cells with endomembrane aggregates have been observed in the roots of plants lacking an isoform of UDP-Glc 4-epimerase (\nuge4\n; \nUehara et al., 2014\n). The \nuge4\n root \nXyG\n contains approximately 50% less Gal than wild-type \nXyG\n (\nNguema-Ona et al., 2006\n; \nRösti et al., 2007\n). Membrane aggregation and cell bulging were suppressed by growing \nuge4\n in the presence of Gal, which led to the suggestion that reduced galactosylation of \nXyG\n or arabinogalactan protein is responsible for endomembrane disorganization (\nUehara et al., 2014\n). Nevertheless, a direct causal relationship between endomembrane aggregation and plant growth is unlikely, as Arabidopsis plants carrying a mutation in the coat promoter complex II coat protein SECRETORY 24A have endomembrane aggregates comparable to \nmur3-3\n but are not dwarfed (\nFaso et al., 2009\n).\nFigure 6.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nEndomembrane aggregation and intracellular accumulation of cell wall polysaccharides in \nmur3-3\n plants.

    "intracellular_aggregates_containing_xyloglucan_and_pectin_ac": "Pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides are believed to be synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and are then transferred from the trans-Golgi network in vesicles that move to and fuse with the plasma membrane (\nBashline et al., 2014\n). The polysaccharides are then released into the apoplast and incorporated into the existing cell wall. Defects in trans-Golgi network-dependent secretion of polysaccharides in the \nechidna\n mutant have been shown to result in the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing pectin and xyloglucan (\nGendre et al., 2013\n). Thus, we examined polysaccharide secretion in \nmur3-3\n, as its cells contain abnormal endomembrane aggregates (\nFig. 6A\n). Intracellular aggregates were clearly visible in the epidermal cells of a toluidine blue-stained cross section of the \nmur3-3\n hypocotyl (\nFig. 6B\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S8A\n). Smaller amounts of aggregates were also visible in \nmur3-1\n hypocotyls (\nFig. 6B\n). These aggregates were labeled with monoclonal antibodies that recognize xyloglucan and deesterified homogalacturonan (\nFig. 6B\n). Few, if any, aggregates were discernible in \nmur3-2,\n wild-type (\nFig. 6B\n), or \n35S\npro\nMUR3:mur3-3\n hypocotyls (\nSupplemental Fig. S8B\n). Taken together, these data provide evidence that, in \nmur3-3\n hypocotyls and to a lesser extent in \nmur3-1\n hypocotyls, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectins, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. These data again support the notion that the phenotype of each \nmur3\n mutant is determined in large part by the amount of catalytically functional MUR3 protein it produces.",
    "temperature_affects_the_growth_of_mur3_plants_and_the_cataly": "Early studies reported that \nmur3-1\n\n\nXyG\n lacks F side chains (\nMadson et al., 2003\n; \nPeña et al., 2004\n), although subsequent analyses indicated that fucosylated subunits account for up to 5% of the \nmur3-1\n and \nxlt2 mur3-1\n\n\nXyG\ns (\nJensen et al., 2012\n; \nSchultink et al., 2013\n; \nVinueza et al., 2013\n). Nevertheless, those values are lower than the values we obtained (\nFig. 4A\n). As our plants were grown at 19°C rather than at 22°C or 26°C as in the earlier studies, we determined whether temperature affects the extent of \nXyG\n fucosylation or plant growth.\nThere was an approximately 85% decrease in the relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits in the \nXyG\n from \nmur3-1\n and \nxlt2 mur3-1\n plants grown at 28°C (\nFig. 7, A and B\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S9\n). \nxlt2 mur3-1\n mutants grown at 19°C or 28°C do not have a severe cabbage-like phenotype but do have short petioles and slightly curved leaves, making them visibly distinct from wild-type plants (\nFig. 2\n). The relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits in \nmur3-2\n\n\nXyG\n was comparable at both growth temperatures (\nFig. 7\n; \nSupplemental Fig. S9\n). These data confirm that \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n plants retain a residual amount of MUR3 activity and show that, in plants with the allelic (S470L) MUR3-1 protein, \nXyG\n galactosylation at the MUR3 position is diminished by increasing growth temperature.\nFigure 7.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nThe effect of growth temperature on the xyloglucan subunit compositions of selected \nmur3\n and wild-type plants.

That \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n exhibit near-normal growth at 28°C is consistent with the temperature-dependent changes in the rheological properties of Gal-depleted \nXyG\n (\nShirakawa et al., 1998\n). Alternatively, the protective mechanisms activated in plants in response to heat stress (\nBita and Gerats, 2013\n) may suppress the effects of the dysfunctional \nmur3-3\n\n\nXyG\n. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which elevated temperature suppresses the cabbage-like phenotype remain to be determined. It may well be the case that this phenotype results from an accumulation of temperature- and \nXyG\n structure-dependent modifications that affect both cell wall structure and remodeling and endomembrane organization.",

    "dysfunctional_xyloglucan_and_plant_growth": "Our data show that the extent of side chain galactosylation in \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n\n\nXyG\n is reduced by approximately 70% compared with the wild type. A probability analysis (see \nSupplemental Protocol S1\n) using the XXXG subunit abundance in the \nXyG\n from \nmur3-3\n (63%), \nmur3-7\n (73%), the wild type (25%), \nmur3-1\n (48%), \nmur3-2\n (47%), and \n35S\npro\nMUR3\n:\nmur3-3\n (29%) plants predicts that domains consisting of five or more tandemly repeated XXXG sequences comprise a much higher proportion of the \nXyG\n in \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n plants than in \nXyG\n from the other plants (\nSupplemental Fig. S11\n). The existence of large tandemly repeated XXXG domains may lead to the aggregation or otherwise aberrant interactions of \nXyG\n with itself and/or with other wall polymers (\nShirakawa et al., 1998\n; \nWhitney et al., 2006\n; \nde Freitas et al., 2011\n). Such interactions together with the inability to extend the side chain adjacent to the unbranched Glc appear to be major factors in the dysfunctional properties of the \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n\n\nXyG\n and the cabbage-like phenotype of these plants. The aggregation of the nascent \nmur3-3\n and \nmur3-7\n\n\nXyG\ns may prevent the normal movement of \nXyG\n through the Golgi and the packaging of \nXyG\n in vesicles for delivery to the apoplast, and may also account for the abnormal membrane organization and the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing wall polysaccharides in \nmur3-3\n plants.\nThe differences in subunit composition of the \nmur3-3\n and \nxlt2 mur3-1\n\n\nXyG\ns (\nFig. 7\n) indicate that failure to extend the side chains next to the unbranched Glc is especially detrimental to \nXyG\n function and to plant growth. Most, if not all, of the galactosyl residues adjacent to the unbranched Glc are further extended with Fuc in the \nXyG\n present in the wall of \nxlt2 mur3-1\n plants. Although \nXyG\n fucosylation is not in itself required for the normal growth of laboratory-grown Arabidopsis plants (\nVanzin et al., 2002\n), there is evidence that fucosylation does have a role, albeit less than galactosylation, in the formation of \nXyG\n-cellulose composites (\nWhitney et al., 2006\n).\nDysfunctional xyloglucan may disrupt wall remodeling that is required for plant cells to expand and grow (\nPeña et al., 2004\n; \nPark and Cosgrove, 2012a\n, \n2012b\n). For example, the results of in vitro studies suggest that the decreased solubility of Gal-depleted \nXyG\n reduces its accessibility to the action of \nXyG\n endotransglucosylases/hydrolases (XTHs) that are believed to be involved in wall remodeling during cell growth (\nPeña et al., 2004\n). \nLi et al. (2013)\n have reported that the expression of XTH18 is increased 2-fold in \nrsa3-1\n. Thus, the cabbage-like phenotype may result at least in part from the reduced susceptibilities of the \nXyG\n to XTH. These authors also reported a 12-fold increase in the expression of the gene encoding the wall-associated kinase WAK1 (\nLi et al., 2013\n). Since WAKs are likely involved in wall sensing, cell expansion, and responses to pathogens and environmental signals (\nKohorn and Kohorn, 2012\n), they may have a role in communicating changes in wall properties to the cells of the \nmur3\n mutants.\nOur data favor a model that invokes a dysfunctional xyloglucan structure as the most direct cause of the growth defects of plants carrying loss-of-function mutations in \nMUR3\n. Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be discounted that other cellular mechanisms are responsible. For example, the phenotypes observed in plants lacking the MUR3 protein may be a consequence of an \nXyG\n biosynthesis complex (\nChou et al., 2015\n; \nLund et al., 2015\n) that becomes dysfunctional when no MUR3 protein is present. In this scenario, the \nmur3-1\n and \nmur3-2\n mutants are not cabbage like because the residual MUR3 may still be capable of forming a nondysfunctional \nXyG\n biosynthetic complex. However, to be consistent with our data, XLT2, which has 42% amino acid sequence identity with MUR3, must be able to substitute for MUR3 to form a nondysfunctional complex when \nXLT2\n is expressed at sufficiently high levels. \nXLT2\n does not replace \nMUR3\n when expressed at normal levels. This model also requires that the direct effects of the putative dysfunctional biosynthetic complex are suppressed by eliminating the XXT2 or the XXT5 protein in \nmur3-3\n or \nmur3-7\n plants. The \nxxt2 mur3-3\n and \nxxt5 mur3-3\n double mutants have near wild-type morphology and produce xyloglucan with less than 50% unsubstituted XXXG. Models that invoke a dysfunctional biosynthetic complex as the direct cause of the \nmur3-3\n phenotypes are thus complicated by several difficult-to-reconcile requirements.",
    "conclusion": "We have shown that Arabidopsis mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated Xyl than wild-type xyloglucan. This xyloglucan structure is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that exhibit numerous growth defects. Near-normal growth is restored by eliminating the xyloglucan altogether or by increasing the extent of its galactosylation. The altered growth of the \nmur3\n family of mutants and their responses to temperature, pathogens (\nTedman-Jones et al., 2008\n), and salt stress (\nLi et al., 2013\n) reveal how modifying one element of a biochemical network, in this case, xyloglucan biosynthesis, may disturb diverse cellular and physiological processes. Such data provide additional evidence in support of the notion that altering wall structure affects numerous aspects of plant life (\nSeifert and Blaukopf, 2010\n). Thus, the \nmur3\n mutants provide a unique opportunity to increase our understanding of how changes in cell wall biosynthesis and structure affect plant growth and development as well as disease resistance and responses to environmental stimuli.",

The residue was dissolved in 500 μL of water and then freeze dried to remove residual ammonium formate. Positive-ion \nMALDI-TOF\n mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker Microflex LT mass spectrometer and workstation. Solutions (5 μL) of the oligosaccharides (approximately 1 mg mL\n−1\n in water) were mixed with an equal volume of 10 m\nm\n NaCl. A portion of this mixture (1 μL) was then added to a matrix solution (0.1 \nm\n 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in aqueous 50% [v/v] acetonitrile, 1 μL) on the stainless steel MALDI target plate and concentrated to dryness using a flow of warm air from a hair dryer. Spectra from at least 200 laser shots were summed up to generate each mass spectrum.\n\n\n1\nH-NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Inova NMR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) operating at 600 MHz using a 3-mm cold probe and a sample temperature of 25°C. \nXyGO\ns (0.5–1 mg) were dissolved in D\n2\nO (0.7 mL, 99.9% [v/v]; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). All two-dimensional spectra were recorded using standard Varian pulse programs. Chemical shifts were measured relative to internal acetone (δ 2.225). Data were processed using MestReNova software (Universidad de Santiago de Compostela).\nXyloglucan Quantification\n\n\nThe amounts of xyloglucan present in the \nAIR\n were determined by measuring the amounts of isoprimeverose released by Driselase treatment of the \nAIR\n (\nFry, 1982\n). Suspensions of the \nAIR\n (approximately 1 g) from mutant and wild-type plants in aqueous 80% (v/v) ethanol (100 mL) were ball milled for 16 h at 4°C and 90 rpm in ceramic milling jars (0.3 L) containing a mixture of one-fourth- and one-half-inch zirconia milling beads (U.S. Stoneware). The milled \nAIR\n was collected by centrifugation, washed with absolute ethanol and then with acetone, and then vacuum dried at room temperature. Suspensions of the milled \nAIR\n (250–500 mg) in 50 m\nm\n sodium acetate, pH 5.2 (30 mL), were then treated for 24 h at 45°C with Spirizyme (30 μL, Novozymes A/S) and Liquizyme (150 μL, Novozymes A/S) to remove starch. The destarched \nAIR\n was collected by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and freeze dried.\n\n\nTriplicate suspensions of the \nAIR\n (6.25 mg) in 50 m\nm\n ammonium formate, pH 4.7 (500 μL), containing 0.5% (w/v) chlorobutanol were treated for 24 h at 22°C with 0.25% (w/v) Driselase (100 μL, Sigma-Aldrich) prepared as described (\nFry, 1982\n). A second portion of Driselase (50 μL) was added and the suspension kept for a further 24 h at 22°C. Ethanol (1.5 mL) was added and the mixture kept at 4°C overnight. The suspension was centrifuged and the soluble fraction concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in water (1 mL) and freeze dried to remove residual ammonium formate. The residue was dissolved in water (1 mL), and a portion (250 μL) was filtered using a 0.45-μm centrifugal microfilter. Portions (10 μL) of the soluble material were then analyzed using a Dionex ICS-3000 \nHPAEC\n system with pulsed amperometric detection and a CarboPac PA1 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Thermo Fisher). The column was eluted at 1.0 mL min\n−1\n for 5 min with 0.1 \nn\n NaOH, then with a gradient of sodium acetate (0–100 m\nm\n) in 0.1 \nn\n NaOH for 30 min. The column was washed for 15 min with 1 \nm\n sodium acetate in 0.1 \nn\n NaOH and then reequilibrated for 15 min in 0.1 \nn\n NaOH. The chromatography system was calibrated using known amounts of isoprimeverose (Megazyme).\nXyloglucan Subunit Composition Analysis Using \nHPAEC\n with Pulsed Amperometric Detection\n\n\nSolutions (10 μL) of \nXyGO\ns in water (approximately 200 μg mL\n−1\n) released by \nXEG\n treatment of \nAIR\n or the 4 \nn\n KOH-soluble materials were analyzed using a Dionex ICS-3000 system and CarboPac PA1 column (250 × 4.6 mm; Thermo Fisher). The column was eluted at 1.0 mL min\n−1\n for 3 min with 0.1 \nn\n NaOH, from 3 to 5 min with a gradient of sodium acetate (0–40 m\nm\n) in 0.1 \nn\n NaOH and from 5 to 38 min with a gradient of sodium acetate (40–100 m\nm\n) in 0.1 \nn\n NaOH. The column was washed with 1 \nm\n sodium acetate in 0.1 \nn\n NaOH for 7 min and reequilibrated for 15 min in 0.1 \nn\n NaOH. The column was calibrated using known amounts (0.5–2 μg injected) of homogeneous XXXG, XXLG, XLXG, XXFG, XLLG, and XLFG purified from \nXEG\n digests of tamarind and sycamore cell wall xyloglucan (\nTuomivaara et al., 2015\n).\nGlycome Profiling of Plant Cell Wall Extracts\n\n\nAIR\n generated from wild-type and mutant plants (approximately 500 mg) was treated sequentially with α-amylase, endopolygalacturonase, 50 m\nm\n sodium carbonate, 1 \nn\n KOH, 4 \nn\n KOH, and 5 \nn\n KOH containing 3% (w/v) boric acid to generate fractions enriched in pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides. The soluble extracts were adjusted to pH 5 if required, dialyzed (3,500 \nM\nr\n cutoff) against deionized water, and freeze dried.
