    "abstract": "• \nPremise of the study:\n In spaceflight experiments, tissues for morphologic study are fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, while tissues for molecular study are fixed in RNA\nlater\n; thus, an experiment containing both study components requires multiple fixation strategies. The possibility of using RNA\nlater\n-fixed materials for standard SEM-based morphometric investigation was explored to expand the library of tissues available for analysis and maximize usage of samples returned from spaceflight, but these technologies have wide application to any situation where recovery of biological resources is limited.\n• \nMethods and Results:\n RNA\nlater\n-fixed samples were desalinated in distilled water, dehydrated through graded methanol, plunged into liquid ethane, and transferred to cryovials for freeze-substitution. Sample tissues were critical point dried, mounted, sputter-coated, and imaged.\n• \nConclusions:\n The protocol resulted in acceptable SEM images from RNA\nlater\n-fixed \nArabidopsis thaliana\n tissue. The majority of the tissues remained intact, including general morphology and finer details such as root hairs and trichomes.",
    "methods_and_results": "METHODS AND RESULTS\nFor process development, test samples of 9–12-d-old \nA. thaliana\n var. \ncolumbia\n (Col-0) or Wassilewskija (WS) (The Arabidopsis Information Resource [TAIR], Columbus, Ohio, USA) were harvested into RNA\nlater\n and fixed overnight at ambient room temperature. Fixed plants, along with freshly harvested individuals of the same age, were washed in distilled water with gentle rocking for four 1-h increments. This washing step was designed to desalinate RNA\nlater\n-fixed samples, as the salt crystals were found to damage tissue during subsequent steps (\nFig. 1A, B\n). Desalination also returned the plants to a fresh-like state (\nFig. 1C\n, D) suitable for flash-freezing. Tissues were dissected immediately following the final wash into 5–10-mm lengths to fit on the SEM sample stage (“stub”).\nFig. 1.\nPreliminary RNA\nlater\n-fixation investigations. (A, B) \nArabidopsis\n root tip (A) and root tissue (B) were processed through an ethanol dehydration gradient. Tissues were then processed following the protocol in \nAppendix 1\n, starting at the critical-point-drying step. No desalination step occurred. 800×, scale bars = 37.5 μm. (C, D) Light microscopy of fresh-harvested (C) and RNA\nlater\n-fixed (D) \nArabidopsis\n trichomes displaying similar external morphology. 400×, scale bars = 500 μm. (E, F) \nArabidopsis\n root tip (E) and root tissue (F) processed by high-pressure freezing as described in the Methods and Results section. Note fracturing in (F) due to planchette adhesion. 500×, scale bars = 60.0 μm.\nThe first two protocols tested provided valuable lessons. The first cryo-analog protocol was flash freezing in liquid nitrogen (LN\n2\n). Tissues were severely damaged, primarily due to rapid crystallization of water into ice, physically compromising cellular integrity. The second protocol tested was high-pressure freezing (HPF; Bal-Tec HPM100; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), which resulted in vitrified ice and a greater freezing depth. The noncrystalline structure prevented physical damage, but the roots had a tendency to stick to the planchettes and break (\nFig. 1E\n, F).\nThe third protocol tested was based on the lessons learned and resulted in minimal tissue damage. The risk of water–ice crystal formation and planchette adhesion was minimized using a variety of methods. Samples were run through a methanol dehydration gradient, starting at 10% and increasing at 10% intervals, for 10 min at each step. An optional wash of 0.1% tannic acid in methanol was used to enhance electron density (\nMizuhira et al., 1972\n; \nRoholl et al., 1981\n). \nArabidopsis\n tissues were hand-plunged using forceps into LN\n2\n-cooled liquid ethane, which vitrified any remaining water in each sample. These rapid hand-performed plunges provided more control and less damage than automated plunge devices. Samples were immediately transferred to LN\n2\n-cooled individual cryovials, containing either 2% OsO\n4\n in MeOH or 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1% tannic acid. The headspace in each vial was filled with LN\n2\n to prevent samples being lost or damaged due to static electric effects. Cryovials were placed into freeze substitution (Leica EM AFS2; Leica Microsystems) to increase the temperature to 10°C over the course of 4–10 d. Cryovial caps were left slightly loose to vent nitrogen gas. Once the temperature reached 10°C, cryovials were removed, opened, and tissues were transferred to tissue baskets (SPI microporous specimen capsules, 120–200 μm pore size; Structure Probe Inc., West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA) while submerged in chilled (4°C) methanol. This transfer took place at ambient room temperature; the chilled methanol submersion is enough to maintain the integrity of the tissues. Individual baskets were labeled using pencil on a small piece of paper approximately 2 mm\n2\n, as external labels were removed during the drying phase. Drying occurred via liquid CO\n2\n critical point drying (CPD; Bal-Tec CPD 030; Leica Microsystems). Eleven quick-cycled washes replaced most of the loading methanol with CO\n2\n, followed by three 10-min infiltrations. One final exchange was performed and left overnight. Two additional 10-min infiltrations were performed, followed by CPD with controlled venting. Samples were in solution until the end of CPD. Dry samples in baskets were transferred to a desiccant-filled (Drierite; W. A. Hammond Drierite Company, Xenia, Ohio, USA) sealable container until being mounted on stubs using carbon adhesive and returned to a stub rack within a different desiccant-filled sealable container. Mounted samples were sputter-coated for 90 s with a gold-palladium alloy (Desk V HP; Denton Vacuum, Moorestown, New Jersey, USA) and imaged on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).\nInitial observations were focused on roots, resolution of cell files, and retention of root hairs throughout the processing of the tissue (\nFig. 2\n). Later tests observed trichomes and more durable tissues, such as adaxial leaf surfaces and seed coats (\nFig. 2A–C\n). The fresh-frozen tissues, used as protocol development control material, retained finer details, including closed stomata and normal trichome morphology (\nFig. 2D\n, E). RNA\nlater\n-fixed test materials yielded similar images as the fresh-frozen plants, with minimal additional tissue damage (\nFig. 2F–K\n).\nFig. 2.\nSEM images of \nArabidopsis\n tissue processed using the protocol described in the Methods and Results section and \nAppendix 1\n.

(K) RNA\nlater\n-fixed spaceflight root section (700×, scale bar = 42.9 μm).\nSpaceflight materials and the corresponding ground controls, both fixed in RNA\nlater\n, were processed using the protocol discussed above and detailed in \nAppendix 1\n. Tissues yielded images of acceptable quality, with minimal cell wrinkling and high retention of fine details (\nFig. 2J\n, K). The focus of these samples was root structure, morphology, and root hair retention because of interesting molecular and genetic observations from a recent spaceflight experiment (\nPaul et al., 2012\n; Paul et al., unpublished).\nCost of the developed protocol is minimal, while the accessibility is high. Assuming the microscopy core to be used has standard SEM capability, the additional cost of this protocol is merely the cost of consumables. These components are readily available and likely already obtained by the laboratory interested in using this protocol. Another advantage of this protocol is a near retention of tissue morphology at a fresh harvest state. Not only are finer elements of tissues retained (\nFig. 2D–I\n), but other tissues, such as the adaxial leaf epidermis, seed coat, and floral stalk (\nFig. 2A–C\n), produce results comparable to those processed through dedicated morphologic means (e.g., \nBhargava et al., 2013\n). The amount of time needed for this process is slightly longer than other standard SEM processing times, with an additional 4 h for the desalination washes and several days required for freeze substitution. Hand-plunged samples may be processed in batches to increase throughput, being limited to the number of samples able to be held with a pair of forceps without compromising structural integrity. Examples of other SEM protocols may be seen in \nLiu et al. (2008)\n, \nKoizumi et al. (2010)\n, \nSpringer et al. (2010)\n, and \nYi et al. (2010)\n. As a result of this protocol, samples fixed with RNA\nlater\n retained many fine features including root hairs and trichomes, with a majority of cells inflated and displaying fresh-frozen–like morphology, regardless of whether they were harvested during spaceflight or on the ground.",
    "conclusions": "CONCLUSIONS\nThe protocol presented here provides distinct advantages for both spaceflight and ground-based experimental applications. \nArabidopsis\n plants harvested on the International Space Station by astronauts were successfully retrieved from RNA\nlater\n and processed to produce acceptable quality images without the use of a dedicated morphologic fixative (\nFig. 2J\n, K). Field studies may also benefit from the use of this protocol. As in spaceflight, the amount of materials able to be carried and used during an expedition is limited. With the option of using one stable, safe chemical fixative for all desired studies to be conducted upon return, scientists in the field may be able to collect more data with fewer trips. This protocol may also assist laboratories with libraries of samples in RNA\nlater\n by expanding the available techniques for study.\nAlternative imaging techniques outside the scope of this investigation provide alternatives to this protocol. True cryo-SEM would likely be an acceptable alternative (examples may be seen in \nKoroleva et al., 2010\n; \nSarsby et al., 2012\n; and \nYu et al., 2013\n), though desalination of specimens prior to tissue processing would still be beneficial. A second option is a cryo-holder, seen in \nTang et al. (2012)\n, which may prove to be an acceptable alternative step in this protocol if the SEM being used can handle the LN\n2\n vapors. A third alternative is scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM; \nMarti et al., 1988\n; \nHansma et al., 1989\n; \nUshiki et al., 2012\n). Due to the high ionic content of RNA\nlater\n and the necessity for an ionic submersion liquid for SICM, it is possible that this instrument could generate comparable images without any tissue processing. This possibility was not tested due to lack of access to the necessary equipment.\nThe protocol reported here will likely require optimization for each desired tissue to be tested. \nArabidopsis\n is a very fragile tissue, with limited flat surfaces and small organ sizes. Other plants that may be more robust may tolerate a rougher technique, while more fragile tissues (i.e., floral tissues) may need a more gentle approach. Some potential additional steps to enhance tissue integrity include a postfixation step or reversing CPD and sputter-coating. A postfixation step (as seen in \nBehrendt et al., 2011\n), which would take place after the desalination, could improve tissue integrity during the cryo-analog plunge, especially if fixatives for electron microscopy, such as Karnovsky’s or OsO\n4\n, are used. Sputter-coating prior to CPD (as seen in \nYi et al., 2010\n) may also improve the physical tissue integrity, though both mounting prior to CPD and pulling a vacuum during the coating process may prove difficult.\nThe use of this protocol provides more morphological opportunities for samples that would have previously been wasted due to improper fixation. It is designed to be a supplement to rather than a replacement of SEM standard practices. Although this process needs to be adapted to each sample being studied, it enhances flexibility in experiments when the main objective is not imaging."
