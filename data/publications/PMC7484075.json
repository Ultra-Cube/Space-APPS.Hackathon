    "abstract": "The whole-genome sequences of 26 strains isolated from the International Space Station were generated, and the strains were identified as being members of the order \nEnterobacteriales.\n Characterization of these whole-genome sequences might enable the identification of potential pathogenic bacteria that have been adapting to the space environment.",
    "announcement": "ANNOUNCEMENT\nMembers of the order \nEnterobacteriales\n have been found to exhibit human pathogenicity and therefore pose a health risk for people on Earth and for astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) (\n1\n, \n2\n). The latter is of concern for long-duration missions, as astronauts have been shown to be immunocompromised (\n3\n). Importantly, these bacteria are able to adapt to extreme conditions such as microgravity and radiation and thus persist, necessitating the development of appropriate countermeasures to control them. Members of the order \nEnterobacteriales\n that were found on ISS surfaces were \nPantoea brenneri\n, \nPantoea agglomerans\n, \nKalamiella piersonii\n, and \nEnterobacter bugandensis\n (\n4\n–\n6\n). On Earth, \nP. agglomerans\n and \nP. brenneri\n were reported to have been isolated from human infections (\n4\n). \nK. piersonii\n is a member of a novel genus in the family \nErwiniaceae\n that has exhibited resistance to multiple clinical drugs, such as penicillin and vancomycin, allowing it to be an emerging pathogen (\n5\n). \nE. bugandensis\n was documented from blood as a causative agent of septicemia in various geological locations (\n7\n). Analyses of draft genome assemblies for these species might pave the way to identify the genetic processes responsible for potential pathogenicity, as previously reported for some of these strains (\n5\n, \n6\n).\nThe strains used for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were isolated from four different locations in the ISS across three flights and are detailed in \nTable 1\n (\n8\n). The ISS surface samples collected and brought back to Earth were aseptically handled, suitable aliquots of the sample concentrate (100 μl) were plated onto Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) medium and incubated at 25°C for 7 days, and a single well-isolated colony was archived at −80°C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from cultures grown in R2A medium using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nTABLE 1\nMetadata and genome statistics for \nEnterobacter\n, \nKalamiella\n, and \nPantoea\n strains isolated from various ISS environmental surfaces during the Microbial Tracking 1 flight project\nSample name\nNearest species identity\na\n\n\nGenBank accession no.\nRaw sequence accession no.\nFlight(s) or facility\nb\n\n\nSampling location\nc\n\n\nNo. of contigs\nd\n\n\nGenome size (bp)\nN\n50\n (bp)\nMedian coverage (×)\nNo. of quality-controlled reads\nNo. of raw reads (×10\n6\n)\nG+C content (%)\nIF2SW-B4\nE. bugandensis\nJABWOY000000000\nSRR11885007\nF1-2\nWHC\n36\n4,892,220\n511,556\n657.59\n34,787,506\n17.5\n55.9\nIFACSW-B2\nE. bugandensis\nJABWOX000000000\nSRR11885006\nF1\nFC\n40\n4,892,163\n481,191\n662.95\n35,107,666\n17.6\n55.9\nIFACSW-B4\nE. bugandensis\nJABWOW000000000\nSRR11885005\nF1\nFC\n35\n4,892,584\n808,304\n606.70\n31,965,988\n16.0\n55.9\nIFACSW-B5\nE. bugandensis\nJABWOV000000000\nSRR11885004\nF1\nFC\n37\n4,891,741\n481,191\n672.32\n35,130,172\n17.7\n55.9\nIFACSW-P1\nE. bugandensis\nJABWOU000000000\nSRR11885003\nF1\nFC\n36\n4,891,763\n808,252\n640.18\n35,538,578\n17.9\n55.9\nIF2SW-F2\nE. bugandensis\nJACBPD000000000\nSRR12071883\nF1-2\nWHC\n25\n4,892,159\n511,419\n547.77\n29,062,046\n14.5\n55.9\nIF2SW-F3\nE. bugandensis\nJACBPE000000000\nSRR12071879\nF1-2\nWHC\n22\n4,892,298\n808,302\n518.30\n27,421,928\n13.7\n55.9\nF3-6B(4)\nK. piersonii\nJACBPM000000000\nSRR12071882\nF3-6\nPMM\n39\n4,850,268\n503,530\n313.39\n17,045,882\n8.5\n57.1\nF3-6B(5)\nK. piersonii\nJACBPN000000000\nSRR12071881\nF3-6\nPMM\n50\n4,850,704\n310,993\n411.16\n24,040,576\n12.0\n57.1\nIIIF_BACT_A\nK. piersonii\nJACBPO000000000\nSRR12071880\nF3-6\nPMM\n42\n4,849,373\n503,411\n441.96\n22,790,000\n11.4\n57.1\nFJII-L5-SW-P2\nP. agglomerans\nJACBPL000000000\nSRR12071872\nJPL SAF II\nCleanroom floor\n26\n4,861,660\n445,707\n413.84\n23,353,202\n11.7\n55.1\nIF5SW-B1\nP. brenneri\nJABWPM000000000\nSRR11885013\nF1-5\nN1-O4\n108\n5,022,545\n216,403\n487.50\n27,782,700\n14.0\n55.9\nIF5SW-B2\nP. brenneri\nJABWPL000000000\nSRR11885012\nF1-5\nN1-O4\n107\n5,023,215\n216,403\n372.32\n20,371,906\n10.2\n55.9\nIFACSW-B3\nP. brenneri\nJABWPK000000000\nSRR11885002\nF1\nFC\n108\n5,023,154\n216,403\n549.11\n31,932,976\n16.0\n55.9\nIF5SW-P1\nP. brenneri\nJABWPJ000000000\nSRR11885001\nF1-5\nN1-O4\n106\n5,023,034\n216,403\n534.38\n32,864,806\n16.5\n55.9\nIF5SW-P2\nP. brenneri\nJABWPI000000000\nSRR11885000\nF1-5\nN1-O4\n106\n5,023,268\n216,131\n586.61\n37,186,174\n18.7\n55.9\nIFACSW-P2\nP. brenneri\nJABWPH000000000\nSRR11884999\nF1\nFC\n108\n5,023,383\n216,403\n553.13\n34,845,798\n17.5\n55.9\nIIF5SW-B1\nP. brenneri\nJABWPG000000000\nSRR11884998\nF1-5\nN1-O4\n106\n5,022,674\n216,137\n436.61\n26,223,526\n13.2\n55.9\nIIF5SW-B2\nP. brenneri\nJABWPF000000000\nSRR11884997\nF1-5\nN1-O4\n106\n5,023,080\n216,403\n460.71\n27,740,334\n13.9\n55.9\nIIF5SW-B5\nP. brenneri\nJABWPE000000000\nSRR11884996\nF1-5\nN1-O4\n111\n5,021,866\n176,626\n366.96\n22,097,600\n11.1\n55.9\nIIF5SW-P1\nP. brenneri\nJACBPF000000000\nSRR12071878\nF2-5\nN1-O4\n75\n5,020,903\n176,626\n444.64\n26,701,110\n13.4\n55.9\nIIF5SW-P2\nP. brenneri\nJACBPG000000000\nSRR12071877\nF2-5\nN1-O4\n75\n5,022,945\n216,403\n451.34\n26,675,346\n13.4\n55.9\nIIF5SW-P3\nP. brenneri\nJACBPH000000000\nSRR12071876\nF2-5\nN1-O4\n75\n5,021,950\n216,403\n459.38\n26,806,520\n13.5\n55.9\nIIF5SW-P4\nP. brenneri\nJACBPI000000000\nSRR12071875\nF2-5\nN1-O4\n75\n5,023,133\n216,403\n586.61\n35,389,420\n17.8\n55.9\nIIF5SW-P5\nP. brenneri\nJACBPJ000000000\nSRR12071874\nF2-5\nN1-O4\n75\n5,023,087\n216,131\n510.27\n29,693,196\n14.9\n55.9\nIIFCSG-B1\nP. brenneri\nJACBPK000000000\nSRR12071873\nCRV2\nCRV-FC\n74\n5,022,524\n216,403\n345.54\n20,467,790\n10.3\n55.9\na\nThe 16S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved from the whole-genome sequence of the queried genome and analyzed with BLAST against type strains for all 16S rRNA sequences in the NCBI database. The bacterial species identity was determined when the queried sequence showed >97.5% similarity to the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain (\nE. bugandensis\n DSM 29888\nT\n, \nK. piersonii\n DSM 108198\nT\n, \nP. agglomerans\n DSM 3493\nT\n, or \nP. brenneri\n DSM 24232\nT\n). The whole-genome sequence of the nearest neighbor was further selected for ANI evaluation. The ANI value for all strain comparisons was 99%.\nb\nHyphenated designations indicate the flight number followed by the location; for example, F1-2 indicates flight 1 and location 2.

The NovaSeq 6000 system with an S4 flow cell (paired-end 2 × 150-bp reads) was used to execute paired-end sequencing. FastQC (v0.11.7) was used to validate the quality of the raw sequencing data (\n9\n). Adapter trimming and quality filtering were carried out using the software fastp (v0.20.0) to perform quality control (\n10\n). The cleaned sequences were assembled using SPAdes (v3.11.1) (\n11\n). The \nN\n50\n values, numbers of contigs, and total genome lengths were generated using QUAST (v5.0.2) and used to assess the quality of the final assembly (\n12\n). The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were calculated by comparing all strains to their respective type strains, and their taxonomic affiliations and genome statistics are given in \nTable 1\n (\n13\n). The NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) (v.4.11 and v.4.12) was used for genome annotation. Default parameters were used for all software.\nData availability.\nThis WGS project was deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank (accession numbers are given in \nTable 1\n [BioProject accession no. \nPRJNA635942\n]) and also deposited in the NASA GeneLab database (accession no. \nGLDS-302\n and \nGLDS-311\n).
