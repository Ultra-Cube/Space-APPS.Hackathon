    "abstract": "Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by filamentous fungi possess diverse bioactivities that make them excellent drug candidates. Whole genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the capacity to produce a far greater number of SMs than have been isolated, since many of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions. There has been significant effort to activate SM biosynthetic genes and link them to their downstream products, as the SMs produced by these “cryptic” pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery. Further, an understanding of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis facilitates product yield optimization of first-generation molecules and genetic engineering of second-generation analogs. This review covers advances made in genome mining SMs produced by \nAspergillus nidulans\n, \nAspergillus fumigatus\n, \nAspergillus niger\n, and \nAspergillus terreus\n in the past six years (2012–2018). Genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters, along with proposed biosynthetic pathways, will be discussed in depth.",
    "1._introduction": "Filamentous fungi, including those within the \nAspergillus\n genus, are known to produce a vast array of secondary metabolites (SMs) that exhibit a broad range of biological activities. SMs are organic small molecules that confer selective advantage to the organism despite not being directly required for survival. In nature, SMs function as weapons to eliminate neighboring competition, chemical signals in microbial cell communication, agents of symbiosis and transportation, sexual hormones, or differentiation effectors.\n1\n However, SMs also possess various characteristics that make them great drug candidates, which has resulted in their extensive use in the pharmaceutical industry. For example, they exhibit enormous structural and chemical diversity due to the enzymatic nature of their biosynthesis, in which the core backbone of the SM is often biosynthesized by either a polyketide synthase (PKS), which can be either non-reducing (NR-PKS) or highly-reducing (HR-PKS), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), a PKS–NRPS hybrid, a dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase (DMATS), or a terpene cyclase (TC). The carbon skeleton is then further diversified by various tailoring enzymes encoded by genes that are usually clustered in the genome with the SM core backbone gene.\n2\n Tailoring enzymes may include oxidoreductases, oxygenases, dehydrogenases, reductases, and transferases. This process facilitates many reactions that are not possible synthetically and therefore SMs often feature more chiral centers and increased steric complexity than synthetic molecules. Further, because SMs have evolved within a biological setting, they usually possess many favorable drug-like properties. SMs currently represent a significant source of antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, anti-infective, anticancer, and antidiabetic drugs.\n3\n Notable examples include the antibiotic penicillin, the cholesterol-lowering statin lovastatin, the antitumor agent paclitaxel,\n4\n and the immunosuppressant cyclosporine.\n5\n Additionally, the majority of small-molecule drugs introduced between 1981 and 2010 were either SMs, SM derivatives, SM mimics, or possessed a SM pharmacophore, and approximately 49% of all anticancer drugs are SMs or were inspired by SMs.\n3\nGenome sequencing of \nAspergillus\n species has greatly illuminated the potential for further drug discovery within the \nAspergillus\n genus, revealing that the number of predicted SM biosynthetic genes or gene clusters considerably exceeds the number of identified SMs. A primary reason for this is that the majority of genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions.\n6\n This is a logical phenomenon given the natural functions of SMs, as laboratory culture conditions lack the life-threatening or competitive circumstances likely to trigger SM production. Expression of these genes sometimes requires exposure to a specific condition or stressful environment, and therefore culturing fungi in various conditions can result in the production of different SMs.\n7\n Other times, genetic engineering techniques, such as heterologous expression or the use of inducible promoters, are required. Since the sequencing of the first \nAspergillus\n genome in 2005,\n8\n researchers have used bioinformatics to identify and characterize the SM biosynthetic gene clusters present in various species of \nAspergillus\n.\n9\n There have been considerable efforts to activate silent clusters and link them to their downstream products, as genome mining these “cryptic” pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery.\n10\n Further, linking known therapeutically-relevant SMs to their biosynthesis genes facilitates genetic manipulation efforts to optimize product yields of first-generation compounds and engineer second-generation compounds.\nIn 2012, a comprehensive review depicting the status \nAspergillus\n SM research was published by J. F. Sanchez \net al.\n11\n Building on this previous work, this review examines advances made in \nAspergillus\n SM genome mining efforts since 2012. Specifically, it focuses on progress made within the species of \nAspergillus nidulans\n, \nAspergillus fumigatus\n, \nAspergillus niger\n, and \nAspergillus terreus\n, which are distinguished for their significant use in research, medicine, and biotechnology. The well-characterized fungus \nA. nidulans\n has been extensively used as a model organism to study genetics and cell biology. Additionally, the development of \nA. nidulans\n “clean background” strains, which are lacking production of common SMs, combined with the availability of regulatable promoters and several genetic selection markers have facilitated its wide use as a heterologous expression host.\n12\n The common airborne pathogen \nA. fumigatus\n threatens immunocompromised individuals and is responsible for most invasive aspergillosis infections, although infections can also be caused by \nA. flavus\n, \nA. terreus\n, \nA. niger\n, and \nA. nidulans\n.\n13\n,\n14\n Nevertheless, \nA. fumigatus\n is known to produce biologically useful SMs, including fumitremorgin C, which exhibits potent activity against the breast cancer resistance protein.\n15\n Melanized \nA. niger\n is used extensively in the biotechnology industry for production of citric acid and enzymes.\n16\n Additionally, it produces an array of therapeutically relevant SMs, including the antimicrobial aurasperone A,\n17\n the antioxidant and antifungal aurasperone B,\n18\n the human cancer cytotoxic agent bicoumanigrin A,\n19\n and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A.\n20\nA. terreus\n is used for biotechnological production of the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin\n21\n,\n22\n and the industrial polymer precursor itaconic acid.\n23\n,\n24",
    "2._the_status_of_genome_mining_aspergillus_secondary_metabol": "The overall status of linking predicted SM core backbone synthase enzymes to their downstream products in \nA. nidulans\n, \nA. fumigatus\n, \nA. niger\n, and \nA. terreus\n is summarized in \nTable 1\n. Of the 66 predicted core synthase enzymes in the \nA. nidulans\n genome, 29 (43.9%) have been linked to downstream SM products. Similarly, of the 40 predicted SM core synthase enzyme-encoding genes in \nA. fumigatus\n, 19 (47.5%) have been linked to downstream SM products. While the \nA. niger\n and \nA. terreus\n genomes contains 99 and 74 predicted SM synthase enzymes, only 14 (14.1%) and 20 (27.0%) have been linked to their products, respectively. \nTables 2–5\n list the predicted SM core synthase genes and linked cluster products in \nA. nidulans\n, \nA. fumigatus\n, \nA. niger\n, and \nA. terreus\n, respectively. The following sections review the specific advances made in the genetic characterization and biosynthetic pathway elucidation of SMs produced by these four species in the past six years (2012–2018). It is important to note that the levels of details that have been clarified for these pathways varies quite significantly, as some pathways have been proposed with considerable detail while others involve sole characterization of the core synthase enzyme.\nTable 1.

Biosynthesis of \nent\n-pimara-8(14),15-diene\n\n\nThe silent SM gene cluster of the novel diterpene \nent\n-pimara-8(14),15-diene was activated through overexpression of the Zn(\nii\n)\n2\nCys\n6\n transcription factor PbcR present in the cluster.\n25\n This led to high up-regulation of 7 adjacent genes encoding a diterpene synthase, a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, a HMG-CoA reductase, a translation elongation factor, a short-chain dehydrogenase, a hypothetical protein with partial similarity to methyltransferase, and a cytochrome P450, as well as the production of \nent\n-pimara-8(14),15-diene. Based on this information, the biosynthesis of \nent\n-pimara-8(14),15-diene was proposed to involve HMG-CoA reductase AN1593 to generate mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase AN1592 to generate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (\nScheme 1\n). Next, the diterpene synthase AN1594 was proposed to catalyze two cyclization reactions to generate \nent\n-pimara-8(14),15-diene through a \nent\n-copalyl diphosphate intermediate.\n\n\nScheme 1.

Biosynthesis of asperniduglene A1\n\n\nThe asperniduglenes were discovered upon activation of the \nsdg\n gene cluster in \nA. nidulans\n, which harbors genes with similarity to the citreoviridin (\nctv\n) gene cluster in \nA. terreus\n.\n26\n Interestingly, despite the similarity of the cluster to the \nctv\n cluster, the asperniduglenes fall into a different class of compounds than citreoviridin. The cluster was activated by replacing the promoters of genes within the \nsdg\n cluster with the inducible \nalcA\n promoter. Large-scale cultivation and examination of SMs and intermediates produced by mutant strains enabled the biosynthetic pathway of asperniduglene A1 to be proposed (\nScheme 2\n). First, the polyketide product is biosynthesized by the HR-PKS SdgA, followed by epoxidation by SdgC, and subsequent ketone formation \nvia\n Meinwald rearrangement, likely catalyzed by SdgF. Next, SdgC catalyzes a second epoxidation on the last olefin, followed by stereospecific cyclization and hydrolytic cleavage, both of which may be catalyzed by SdgD, to form asperniduglene A1.\n\n\nScheme 2.

Biosynthesis of aspernidine A\n\n\nThe biosynthetic gene cluster of aspernidine A, which has exhibited antiproliferative activity against tumor cell lines,\n27\n was identified following construction of a genome-wide kinase knockout library in \nA. nidulans\n.\n28\n Screening of the library, which consisted of 98 deletion strains, revealed that deficiency of the mitogen-activated protein kinase MpkA resulted in the production of aspernidines A and C. Structural analysis indicated that aspernidines A and C are likely derived from orsellinaldehyde, which suggested the involvement of the NR-PKS PkfA in their biosynthesis.\n29\n Individual deletion of genes within the \npkf\n cluster in the \nmpkA\n-genetic background strain resulted in the discovery of related compounds aspernidines D and E and allowed a biosynthetic pathway for aspernidine A to be partially proposed (\nScheme 3\n). Following biosynthesis by PkfA, orsellinaldehyde undergoes \nO\n-methylation, hydroxylation, and prenylation to yield aspernidine D, which is likely catalyzed, in part, by the prenyltransferase PkfE. Aspernidine D is then hydroxylated by cytochrome P450 PkfB to form aspernidine E, which is oxidized by PkfF to generate a dialdehyde intermediate that is subsequently transformed to aspernidine A in a manner that has not been fully clarified yet.\n\n\nScheme 3.

Biosynthesis of microperfuranone\n\n\nTo investigate SMs produced by NRPS-like genes, scientists replaced the native promoters of the 13 predicted NRPS-like genes in \nA. nidulans\n with the inducible \nalcA\n promoter.\n30\n Induction of NRPS-like MicA resulted in enhanced production of microperfuranone, which has previously been isolated from \nAnixiella micropertusa\n and \nEmericella nidulans\n.\n31\n,\n32\n Heterologous expression of \nmicA\n in \nA. niger\n confirmed that MicA is solely responsible for the biosynthesis of microperfuranone, which was proposed to involve the joining of two units of phenylpyruvic acid \nvia\n an aldol condensation reaction while tethered to MicA (\nScheme 4\n). Next, the tethered intermediate undergoes sulfur-mediated cyclization to yield a furan ring, followed by decarboxylation and keto–enol tautomerization to form microperfuranone.\n\n\nScheme 4.

Biosynthesis of fellutamide B\n\n\nFellutamide B, which was originally isolated from \nPenicillium fellutanum\n, is a potent proteasome inhibitor that also induces nerve growth factor release.\n33\n In the past decade proteasome inhibitors have emerged as effective anticancer agents, with several second-generation proteasome inhibitors currently being tested in clinical settings.\n34\n–\n36\n To identify biosynthetic gene clusters that may be involved in the production of proteasome inhibitors, researchers searched for potential resistance genes harbored within SM gene clusters in \nA. nidulans\n.\n37\n Interestingly, they found that within the \ninp\n cluster, \ninpE\n encoded a putative proteasome component, which has no obvious role in SM biosynthesis. The silent \ninp\n cluster was activated by replacing the promoters of six genes within the cluster with the inducible promoter \nalcA\n, which revealed that fellutamide B is the SM cluster's final product. The fellutamide B biosynthetic gene cluster contains two NRPS genes, a predicted fatty-acyl-AMP ligase, a NRPS product release/transfer protein, a transporter, and \ninpE\n, which was found to confer resistance to internally produced fellutamide B.\n37\n Biosynthesis of fellutamide B was proposed to involve initial activation of 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid by IncP to form 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-AMP, which undergoes addition of \nl\n-Asn and \nl\n-Gln while tethered to InpB, followed by addition of \nl\n-Leu while tethered to InpA (\nScheme 5\n). The product is then released to yield fellutamide B.\n\n\nScheme 5. Biosynthesis of fellutamide B in \nA. nidulans\n.\n37\n.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n3.6. Biosynthesis cichorine\n\n\nCulturing of \nA. nidulans\n on yeast extract sucrose (YES) led to the production of cichorine, which is a phytotoxin that possesses activity against corn, soybeans, and knapweed.\n38\n,\n39\n The cichorine biosynthetic gene cluster was identified using targeted individual gene deletions, revealing that the gene cluster consisted of NR-PKS-encoding \npkbA\n, regulatory protein-encoding \ncicD\n, transporter-encoding \ncicA\n, and four tailing protein-encoding genes.\n38\n Analysis of extracts produced by deletion strains enabled some insights into the cichorine biosynthetic pathway (\nScheme 6\n), which involves initial production of 3-methyl-orsellinic acid by the PKS PkbA, which undergoes a ring-closing transformation by CicB and/or CicH, followed by phenol group methylation by CicE to yield nidulol. The remaining steps in cichorine biosynthesis involve a lactone to lactam conversion carried genes found outside the \ncic\n SM gene cluster, perhaps by genes within a different cluster, such as the case with xanthone and terpene biosynthesis in \nA. nidulans\n.\n40\n,\n41\n\n\n\n\nScheme 6.

Biosynthesis aspercryptin\n\n\nResearchers generated a “genetic dereplication” strain, which is deficient in production of most \nA. nidulans\n SMs, including sterigmatocystin,\n42\n the emericellamides,\n43\n asperfurnanone,\n44\n the prenyl xanthones,\n40\n terrequinone,\n45\n F9775A and B,\n46\n asperthecin,\n47\n austinol,\n41\n and dehydroaustinol.\n41\n The clean SM background facilitated the detection of a novel SM, designated as aspercryptin.\n48\n The structure of aspercryptin indicated that it is biosynthesized by a NRPS pathway and involves the incorporation of six amino acids, including threonine, isoleucine, aspartic acid/asparagine, serine, lysine-like, and one unidentified amino acid. NRPS enzymes feature adenylation domains responsible for the correct identification and incorporation of amino acid monomers during SM biosynthesis. Often times, each adenylation domain present within an NRPS is responsible for the incorporation of a different amino acid.\n49\n Therefore, scientists searched for an NRPS containing six adenylation domains \nin silico\n, which revealed NRPS-encoding AN7884. Microarray expression array data had previously revealed that AN7884 was co-regulated with 13 adjacent genes, including genes encoding for a short chain dehydrogenase, a cytochrome P450 hydroxylase, a fatty acid synthase, amino acid aminotransferase, and transporters. Targeted gene deletions confirmed the involvement of these genes in the biosynthesis of aspercryptin, which were designated as \natnA\n–\natnN\n, and evaluation of biosynthetic intermediates in deletion strains facilitated the elucidation of the aspercryptin biosynthetic pathway (\nScheme 7\n). Interestingly, the proposed pathway uses cichorine as a precursor, which was confirmed by deleting the NR-PKS involved in cichorine biosynthesis, which eliminated production of aspercryptin.\n\n\nScheme 7.

Biosynthesis of felinone A\n\n\nTo search for negative regulators of secondary metabolism, researchers generated auxotrophic mutants by replacing the coding sequences of target SM core synthase enzymes with the \nA. fumigatus riboB\n gene (\nAfriboB\n).\n50\n Thus, when the target SM cluster is inactive, the fungus will not be able to survive without media supplementation of riboflavin. The strain was then mutagenized with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (NQO), which causes base-pair substitutions, and subsequent growth without riboflavin enabled the detection of strains in which the induced mutations resulted in SM cluster activation. This technique enabled the identification of the transcription factor \nmcrA\n. Investigation of SM production in mutant strains lacking and overexpressing \nmcrA\n revealed that it is a negative regulator of at least ten SM clusters in \nA. nidulans\n. Additionally, large-scale cultivation of the \nmcrA\n-deletion strain enabled the isolation of the antibiotic felinone A.\n51\n Examination of the structure of felinone A, combined with products previously reported to be produced by the \ndba\n cluster,\n29\n,\n52\n enabled the biosynthetic pathway for felinone A to be proposed (\nScheme 8\n). The pathway involves generation of the polyketide product by the NR-PKS DbaI, followed by dearomatization \nvia\n hydroxylation by the FAD-binding monooxygenase DbaH. The final steps of the pathway include a ring closure to generate an azaphilone ring system followed by several reductive steps that have not been clarified yet.\n\n\nScheme 8.

Biosynthesis 4′-methoxyviridicatin\n\n\nQuinolone alkaloids are a class of SMs that exhibit a broad range of medicinally relevant characteristics, including antibiotic, antiviral, antimalarial, and antitumor activities.\n53\n A 6,6-quinolone scaffold is present in a variety of quinolone alkaloids, including 4′-methoxyviridicatin and structurally similar viridicatin, which exhibits strong activity against \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n.\n54\n To elucidate the biosynthetic nature of this class of compounds, a silent candidate cluster containing genes encoding an NRPS, a prenyltransferase, terpene cyclases, and redox enzymes was activated through overexpression of the NRPS AsqK.\n55\n A combination of \nin vivo\n and \nin vitro\n assays were conducted to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of 4′-methoxyviridicatin (\nScheme 9\n). The proposed pathway involves an anthranilic acid and \nO\n-methyl-\nl\n-tyrosine precursor, which undergo conversion to 4′-methoxycyclopeptin by NRPS AsqK. Next, the dioxygenase AsqJ catalyzes two distinct oxidation reactions, the first being a desaturation reaction to form a double bond and yield 4′-methoxydehydrocyclopeptine, followed by monooxygenation of that double bond to form an epoxide and yield (–)-4′-methoxycyclopenine. Interestingly, this epoxide formation then facilitates subsequent non-enzymatic rearrangement to form the 6,6-quinolone viridiatin scaffold from the 6,7-bicyclic core of (–)-4′-methoxycyclopenine, yielding 4′-methoxyviridicatin.\n\n\nScheme 9.

Biosynthesis of grey-brown conidiophore pigment\n\n\nFungal pigments have a wide range of beneficial properties, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities, and can act as natural alternatives to chemically synthesized colorants.\n56\n Historically, the NRPS IvoA and the phenol oxidase IvoB were known to be involved in grey-brown condidiophore pigment production,\n57\n although its biosynthetic pathway had not been fully elucidated. Additionally, microarray expression data had revealed that the gene adjacent to \nivoA\n, \nivoC\n, was coregulated with \nivoA\n.\n58\n Researchers therefore replaced the native promoters of \nivoA\n, \nivoB\n, and \nivoC\n with the inducible promoter \nalcA\n, which resulted in hyphal accumulation of dark pigments.\n59\n The biosynthetic pathway was reconstructed in a stepwise manner to assign functions to each involved gene, revealing that IvoA is the first NRPS known to acetylate tryptophan, leading to \nN\n-acetyltryptophan. IvoC is then responsible for 6-hydroxylation of \nN\n-tryptophan, followed by subsequent oxidation by IvoB to yield grey-brown conidiophore pigment (\nScheme 10\n).\n\n\nScheme 10.

Endocrocin was previously identified as a biosynthetic intermediate of monodictyphenone that was only produced in strains lacking the activity of the decarboxylase MdpH.\n84\n Bioinformatics were therefore used to search for proteins with similarity to the monodictyphenone-producing NR-PKS MdpG in \nA. nidulans\n, which revealed the identification of three NR-PKS genes within the \nA. fumigatus\n genome. The biosynthetic gene clusters of two of the NR-PKSs suggested a final product more complex than endocrocin, so researchers focused on the third NR-PKS, which they named EncA. The NR-PKS EncA lacked the thioesterase (TE) or Claisen cyclase (CLC) domain that is usually responsible for releasing the nascent polyketide product in this class of enzymes.\n85\n,\n86\n In such TE-less enzymes, the polyketide product is instead released by metallo-β-lactamase-type thioesterases enzymes.\n87\n To confirm involvement of EncA in the biosynthesis of endocrocin, a \nencA\n-mutant was generated, which resulted in a strain deficient in endocrocin production.\n81\n Subsequent deletion of tailoring genes revealed the involvement of the metallo-β-lactamase domain protein EncB and the anthrone oxidase EncC in endocrocin biosynthesis, which enabled its biosynthetic pathway to be proposed (\nScheme 13\n). Surprisingly, deletion of the cluster gene \nencD\n resulted in increased production of endocrocin, which could have occurred for two reasons: EncD may catalyze the formation of an unknown product from endocrocin or EncD may inhibit endocrocin biosynthesis by converting an intermediate to an unknown product.\n81\n\n\nScheme 13.

In contrast to the previous study conducted in CEA10-derived strains with an inactive \ntpc\n cluster, deletion of \nencA\n did not result in complete loss of endocrocin production, although production yields decreased.\n81\n,\n82\n Subsequent generation of a mutant strain deficient in both \nencA\n and \ntpcA\n resulted in a complete loss of endocrocin production. To further investigate the biosynthesis of endocrocin by \ntpc\n-encoded enzymes, genes within the \ntpc\n cluster were individually deleted in the \nencA\n-background, which revealed a second pathway for endocrocin biosynthesis in \nA. fumigatus\n (\nScheme 13\n). Endocrocin is likely a shunt product of the trypacidin biosynthesis, as the beginning pathway steps both involve the production of atrochrysone carboxylic acid from TpcC and TpcB, which then undergoes a loss of H\n2\nO to yield endocrocin anthrone. Formation of endocrocin is then catalyzed by TpcL.\n4.3.

The first few steps are identical to that of endocrocin biosynthesis, with the generation of atrochrysone carboxylic acid from NR-PKS TpcC and metallo-β-lactamase TpcB. TpcK then catalyzes decarboxylation to yield atrochrysone, which then undergoes dehydration to yield emodin anthrone. The anthrone oxygenase TpcL catalyzes the addition of a ketone functional group to yield emodin, followed by activity of the \nO\n-methyltransferase TpcA to yield questin. The remaining steps in the pathway were proposed based on comparison to similar pathways, and involve a ring opening catalyzed by TpcG, TpcI, and TpcF, followed by \nO\n-methylation by both TpcM and TpcH to generate monomethylsulochrin, which is then converted to trypacidin by TpcJ.\n\n\nScheme 14.

To further characterize the cluster, its nine genes were heterologously introduced stepwise in \nAspergillus oryzae\n, which resulted in the production and of helvolic acid and 21 derivatives, three of which exhibited increased antibiotic activity against \nStaphylococcus aureus\n when compared to helvolic acid.\n100\n A biosynthetic pathway was proposed for helvolic acid (\nScheme 15\n), which involves initial cyclization of (3\nS\n)-2,3-oxidosqualene by oxidosqualene cyclase HelA to yield protosta-17(20)\nZ\n,24-dien-3β-ol. The intermediate then undergoes two rounds of oxidation by HelB1 and HelB2, followed by acetylation by HelD2, oxidation by HelB4, and oxidative decarboxylation by HelC. Next, HelB3 mediates two oxidative reactions which result in hydroxyl and ketone formation, followed by \nO\n-acetylation by HelD1, and dehydrogenation by HelE to yield helvolic acid. Interestingly, this study revealed unique roles for HelB1 and HelC, which work together to remove the C-4β methyl group through oxidation followed by decarboxylation, a mechanism distinct from the similar demethylation reaction that occurs during sterol biosynthesis.\n\n\nScheme 15.

The product produced by this biosynthetic gene cluster was identified as the novel SM fumipyrrole (\nScheme 16\n).\n\n\nScheme 16.

Shortly after, related fumicyclines A and B were isolated from \nA. fumigatus\n following cocultivation with \nStreptomyces rapamycinicus\n.\n106\n Full genome microarrays were used to identify the gene cluster responsible for production of fumicyclines, which revealed up-regulation of the \nnsc\n/\nfcc\n gene cluster following cocultivation. To confirm the involvement of this cluster, NR-PKS-encoding \nnscA\n/\nfccA\n was deleted, which resulted in complete elimination of fumicycline production. For both studies, the biosynthetic pathway of neosartoricin and fumicyclines was proposed based on the detection of intermediates and shunt products (\nScheme 17\n). Biosynthesis initiates with reactions catalyzed by the NR-PKS NscA/FccA and release of the nascent polyketide product by NscB/FccB. The intermediate then undergoes a loss of CO\n2\n, followed by prenylation catalyzed by NscD/FccD and hydroxylation by NscC/FccC to yield fumicycline B.

Interestingly, although the total synthesis of fumagillin has been well-studied,\n111\n,\n112\n its biosynthetic pathway had not been elucidated. Researchers therefore examined SM clusters harboring genes encoding HR-PKSs in \nA. fumigatus\n, and identified a candidate cluster containing genes encoding MetAP-2 and a type 1 MetAP, which they hypothesized might be involved in self-resistance against fumgaillin.\n113\n To confirm that this cluster was responsible for fumagillin production, the cluster's HR-PKS, designated \nfma\n-PKS, was deleted, which resulted in complete elimination of fumagillin production. \nIn vitro\n assays were used to decipher the functions of other enzymes encoded within the \nfma\n cluster, which enabled the biosynthetic pathway of fumagillin to be proposed (\nScheme 18\n). Biosynthesis of the terpenoid portion of the carbon backbone involves initial generation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which is converted to sesquiterpene β-\ntrans\n-bergamotene by the terpene cyclase \nfma\n-TC, which then undergoes two rounds of epoxidation, dihydroxylation, and \nO\n-methylation to yield fumagillol. In parallel, the HR-PKS \nfma\n-PKS biosynthesizes the polyketide product, which is then combined with fumagillol in a reaction catalyzed by \nfma\n-AT. The intermediate's terminal alkene is then epoxidated, followed by hydrolysis to yield a vicinal diol, followed by cleavage to yield an aldehyde, and oxidation to generate fumagillin.\n\n\nScheme 18.

Microarrays were compared to identify gene clusters that exhibited down-regulation in \nlaeA\n-deletion strains and up-regulation in response to host exposure/hypoxia.\n69\n–\n72\n Such comparison revealed the identification of the \nhas\n eight-gene cluster, harboring genes encoding the NRPS HasD, the DMATS HasE, two C6 transcription factors HasA and HasF, the transporter HasB, the \nO\n-methyltransferase HasC, the FAD binding protein HasG, and the cytochrome P450 HasH.\n73\n C6 transcription factors commonly regulate expression of genes within a SM cluster and \nhasA\n was highly down-regulated in the \nlaeA\n-mutant strain. Researchers therefore overexpressed \nhasA\n by replacing its promoter with the constitutive \ngdpA\n promoter, which led to activation of the \nhas\n gene cluster and production of the Fe(\niii\n) complex hexadehydroastechrome. Interestingly, activation of the \nhas\n cluster enhanced the virulence of \nA. fumigatus\n, significantly decreasing the survival of infected mice.\n73\n To investigate the biosynthetic pathway of hexadehydroastechrome, individual gene knockout mutants were generated for \nhasB\n–\nhasE\n in the OE::\nhasA\n genetic background strain. Biosynthesis of hexadehydroastechrome initiates by loading the NRPS HasD with \nl\n-tryptophan and \nl\n-alanine, followed by prenylation of the Trp-Ala-dipeptide (\nScheme 12\n). The subsequent biosynthetic tailoring reactions performed by HasH, HasC, and HasG were proposed to occur while the intermediate remains tethered to the NRPS.

Endocrocin was previously identified as a biosynthetic intermediate of monodictyphenone that was only produced in strains lacking the activity of the decarboxylase MdpH.\n84\n Bioinformatics were therefore used to search for proteins with similarity to the monodictyphenone-producing NR-PKS MdpG in \nA. nidulans\n, which revealed the identification of three NR-PKS genes within the \nA. fumigatus\n genome. The biosynthetic gene clusters of two of the NR-PKSs suggested a final product more complex than endocrocin, so researchers focused on the third NR-PKS, which they named EncA. The NR-PKS EncA lacked the thioesterase (TE) or Claisen cyclase (CLC) domain that is usually responsible for releasing the nascent polyketide product in this class of enzymes.\n85\n,\n86\n In such TE-less enzymes, the polyketide product is instead released by metallo-β-lactamase-type thioesterases enzymes.\n87\n To confirm involvement of EncA in the biosynthesis of endocrocin, a \nencA\n-mutant was generated, which resulted in a strain deficient in endocrocin production.\n81\n Subsequent deletion of tailoring genes revealed the involvement of the metallo-β-lactamase domain protein EncB and the anthrone oxidase EncC in endocrocin biosynthesis, which enabled its biosynthetic pathway to be proposed (\nScheme 13\n). Surprisingly, deletion of the cluster gene \nencD\n resulted in increased production of endocrocin, which could have occurred for two reasons: EncD may catalyze the formation of an unknown product from endocrocin or EncD may inhibit endocrocin biosynthesis by converting an intermediate to an unknown product.\n81\nScheme 13. Biosynthesis of endocrocin in \nA. fumigatus\n.\n81\n.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\nRedundant biosynthesis of endocrocin by the \ntpc\n cluster was later revealed upon elucidation of the trypacidin biosynthetic pathway in \nA. fumigatus\n strain Af293, which will be discussed more thoroughly in the following section.\n82\n To investigate any interrelationships between endocrocin and trypacidin, \nencA\n was deletion in the trypacidin-producing Af293 strain. In contrast to the previous study conducted in CEA10-derived strains with an inactive \ntpc\n cluster, deletion of \nencA\n did not result in complete loss of endocrocin production, although production yields decreased.\n81\n,\n82\n Subsequent generation of a mutant strain deficient in both \nencA\n and \ntpcA\n resulted in a complete loss of endocrocin production. To further investigate the biosynthesis of endocrocin by \ntpc\n-encoded enzymes, genes within the \ntpc\n cluster were individually deleted in the \nencA\n-background, which revealed a second pathway for endocrocin biosynthesis in \nA. fumigatus\n (\nScheme 13\n). Endocrocin is likely a shunt product of the trypacidin biosynthesis, as the beginning pathway steps both involve the production of atrochrysone carboxylic acid from TpcC and TpcB, which then undergoes a loss of H\n2\nO to yield endocrocin anthrone.

Biosynthesis of kotanin\n\n\nTo identify the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of the bicoumarin kotanin in \nA. niger\n, scientists searched for gene clusters containing NR-PKS genes, since formation of the monomeric coumarin does not require any reduction steps.\n114\n The candidate clusters were further narrowed down to include only clusters harboring cytochrome P450 or monooxygenases, which would be required for kotanin production. The NR-PKS required for kotanin biosynthesis was confirmed to be KtnS through targeted gene deletion, which led to complete loss of coumarin production. The functions of the other genes within the cluster were investigated using targeted gene deletions, which confirmed the involvement of the \nO\n-methyltransferase KtnB and the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase KtnC in kotanin biosynthesis, and allowed the biosynthetic pathway for kotanin to be proposed (\nScheme 19\n).

Biosynthesis of azanigerones\n\n\nAlthough many SM gene clusters contain only one encoding PKS, others contain two that can either work in sequence or in convergence to biosynthesize the polyketide product.\n44\n,\n115\n,\n116\n When two PKS enzymes work in sequence, the polyketide chain biosynthesized from the first PKS is transferred to the second PKS, which continues the chain elongation process. Two PKSs working in convergence function independently of one another, and the polyketide products generated from each enzyme are ultimately connected by other pathway enzymes. To explore similar PKS–PKS partnerships in \nA. niger\n, researchers overexpressed a pathway-specific transcription factor that was present in a cluster that also harbored the NR-PKS AzaA and the HR-PKS AzaB, which led to the production of previously unknown azaphilone SMs.\n117\n Azaphilones are a class of compounds that consist of a highly-oxygenated bicyclic core and a chiral quaternary center.\n118\n They are structurally diverse and feature a wide range of bioactivities, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and nematicidal properties.\n118\n The most abundant azaphilone produced in the overexpression strain was designated as azanigerone A. Other related compounds were produced at earlier time points, including FK17-P2a and azanigerones B and C, and azanigerone D was observed to replace azanigerone A at later time points. To further explore the mechanism of collaboration between NR-PKS AzaA and HR-PKS AzaB in azanigerone biosynthesis, an \nazaB\n-deletion strain was generated, which upon culturing led to the accumulation of two new compounds, designated as azanigerones E and F. This suggests a convergence biosynthesis model, in which AzaA and AzaB biosynthesize two discrete polyketide products which are combined at later step in the pathway. Interestingly, this is the first report of convergent collaboration between an NR-PKS and a HR-PKS in SM biosynthesis. These findings, combined with subsequent \nin vitro\n experiments to confirm the role of tailoring enzyme AzaH, enabled scientists to propose a pathway for azaphilone biosynthesis in \nA. niger\n (\nScheme 20\n). The NR-PKS AzaA catalyzes biosynthesis of a hexaketide precursor, which then undergoes a terminal ketone reduction catalyzed by the ketoreductase AzaE to yield FK17-P2a. Next, the monooxygenase AzaH hydroxylates FK17-P2a, which facilitates formation of the pyran-ring and generation of azanigerone E. In parallel, the HR-PKS AzaB biosynthesizes a 2,4-dimethylhexanoyl chain, which is combined with FK17-P2a to generate azanigerone B in a reaction facilitated by the acyltransferase AzaD. Next, azanigerone B is hydroxylated by FAD-dependent monooxygenase AzaG or AzaL to yield azanigerone C, followed by C–C oxidative cleavage by cytochrome P450 AzaI, and oxidation of the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid by AzaJ, yielding azanigerone A.

    "5.1._biosynthesis_of_kotanin": "To identify the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of the bicoumarin kotanin in \nA. niger\n, scientists searched for gene clusters containing NR-PKS genes, since formation of the monomeric coumarin does not require any reduction steps.\n114\n The candidate clusters were further narrowed down to include only clusters harboring cytochrome P450 or monooxygenases, which would be required for kotanin production. The NR-PKS required for kotanin biosynthesis was confirmed to be KtnS through targeted gene deletion, which led to complete loss of coumarin production. The functions of the other genes within the cluster were investigated using targeted gene deletions, which confirmed the involvement of the \nO\n-methyltransferase KtnB and the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase KtnC in kotanin biosynthesis, and allowed the biosynthetic pathway for kotanin to be proposed (\nScheme 19\n). The pathway is initially catalyzed by KtnS to synthesize the pentaketidic dihydroxycoumarin, followed by \nO\n-methylation by KtnB to yield a siderin derivative. Next, KtnC catalyzes an oxidative phenol coupling reaction while controlling regio- and stereoselectivity to generate \nP\n-(+)-orlandin.

    "5.2._biosynthesis_of_azanigerones": "Although many SM gene clusters contain only one encoding PKS, others contain two that can either work in sequence or in convergence to biosynthesize the polyketide product.\n44\n,\n115\n,\n116\n When two PKS enzymes work in sequence, the polyketide chain biosynthesized from the first PKS is transferred to the second PKS, which continues the chain elongation process. Two PKSs working in convergence function independently of one another, and the polyketide products generated from each enzyme are ultimately connected by other pathway enzymes. To explore similar PKS–PKS partnerships in \nA. niger\n, researchers overexpressed a pathway-specific transcription factor that was present in a cluster that also harbored the NR-PKS AzaA and the HR-PKS AzaB, which led to the production of previously unknown azaphilone SMs.\n117\n Azaphilones are a class of compounds that consist of a highly-oxygenated bicyclic core and a chiral quaternary center.\n118\n They are structurally diverse and feature a wide range of bioactivities, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and nematicidal properties.\n118\n The most abundant azaphilone produced in the overexpression strain was designated as azanigerone A. Other related compounds were produced at earlier time points, including FK17-P2a and azanigerones B and C, and azanigerone D was observed to replace azanigerone A at later time points. To further explore the mechanism of collaboration between NR-PKS AzaA and HR-PKS AzaB in azanigerone biosynthesis, an \nazaB\n-deletion strain was generated, which upon culturing led to the accumulation of two new compounds, designated as azanigerones E and F. This suggests a convergence biosynthesis model, in which AzaA and AzaB biosynthesize two discrete polyketide products which are combined at later step in the pathway. Interestingly, this is the first report of convergent collaboration between an NR-PKS and a HR-PKS in SM biosynthesis. These findings, combined with subsequent \nin vitro\n experiments to confirm the role of tailoring enzyme AzaH, enabled scientists to propose a pathway for azaphilone biosynthesis in \nA. niger\n (\nScheme 20\n). The NR-PKS AzaA catalyzes biosynthesis of a hexaketide precursor, which then undergoes a terminal ketone reduction catalyzed by the ketoreductase AzaE to yield FK17-P2a. Next, the monooxygenase AzaH hydroxylates FK17-P2a, which facilitates formation of the pyran-ring and generation of azanigerone E. In parallel, the HR-PKS AzaB biosynthesizes a 2,4-dimethylhexanoyl chain, which is combined with FK17-P2a to generate azanigerone B in a reaction facilitated by the acyltransferase AzaD. Next, azanigerone B is hydroxylated by FAD-dependent monooxygenase AzaG or AzaL to yield azanigerone C, followed by C–C oxidative cleavage by cytochrome P450 AzaI, and oxidation of the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid by AzaJ, yielding azanigerone A. Azanigerone A can then undergo addition of NH\n3\n to generate azanigerone D, which was observed to replace azanigerone A production at later time points.\nScheme 20.

Despite the significant progress made in the past six years, many SMs that \nAspergillus\n species have the capacity to produce still have not been identified or linked to their biosynthetic gene clusters, which remains true for many other fungal species. Thorough characterization of the \nAspergillus\n secondary metabolome will require a combination of approaches, including the use of inducible promoters, overexpression of pathway-specific regulators, growth in various conditions, heterologous expression, and gene knockout techniques, along with the collaborative effort of the research community.",
