    "summary": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling network triggered by overload of protein-folding demand in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition termed ER stress. The UPR is critical for growth and development; nonetheless, connections between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a link between the UPR and the phytohormone auxin, a master regulator of plant physiology. We show that ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin sensors and transporters in \nArabidopsis thaliana\n. We also demonstrate that an \nArabidopsis\n mutant of a conserved ER stress sensor IRE1 exhibits defects in the auxin response and levels. These data not only support that the plant IRE1 is required for auxin homeostasis, they also reveal a species-specific feature of IRE1 in multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, by establishing that UPR activation is reduced in mutants of ER-localized auxin transporters, including PIN5, we define a long-neglected biological significance of ER-based auxin regulation. We further examine the functional relationship of IRE1 and PIN5 by showing that an \nire1 pin5\n triple mutant enhances defects of UPR activation and auxin homeostasis in \nire1\n or \npin5\n. Our results imply that the plant UPR has evolved a hormone-dependent strategy for coordinating ER function with physiological processes.\nKeywords:\n ER stress, unfolded protein response, auxin response, IRE1, PIN5, \nArabidopsis thaliana",
    "introduction": "The UPR adjusts the ER protein folding capacity to cope with the dynamic secretory protein demands in cells (\nKozutsumi \net al.\n 1988\n, \nSchroder and Kaufman 2005\n). When the ER protein folding machinery is competent, stress sensors are restrained in the ER by ER-resident chaperones (\nBertolotti \net al.\n 2000\n, \nKimata \net al.\n 2003\n). Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates ER stress sensors either by causing them to dissociate from protein chaperones or to associate with unfolded proteins (\nBertolotti, \net al\n. 2000\n, \nCredle \net al.\n 2005\n, \nGardner and Walter 2011\n, \nKimata \net al\n. 2003\n). Activated ER stress sensors transmit signals to the nucleus for transcriptional regulation of UPR target genes (\nKozutsumi \net al\n. 1988\n, \nSchroder and Kaufman 2005\n). If ER stress is not resolved, the UPR triggers the activation of cell death (\nLin \net al.\n 2007\n). IRE1, the only identified ER stress sensor in yeast, is conserved in multicellular eukaryotes (\nCox \net al.\n 1993\n, \nMori \net al.\n 1993\n). Two IRE1 homologues, AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B, have been proven to be functional ER stress sensors in \nArabidopsis\n (\nChen and Brandizzi 2012\n, \nNagashima \net al.\n 2011\n). The activation of IRE1 relies on auto-phosphorylation, conformational modification, and oligomerization. Activated IRE1 splices an intron from the mRNA of a UPR-specific bZIP transcription factor (\nCox and Walter 1996\n). The spliced transcription factor enters the nucleus to control UPR target genes (\nCox and Walter 1996\n).\nThe UPR is critical for numerous fundamental cellular processes (\nWu and Kaufman 2006\n). IRE1 alpha knockout mice exhibit embryonic lethality (\nIwawaki \net al.\n 2009\n). Dysregulation of the UPR contributes to the pathology of several significant diseases, including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer (\nMarciniak and Ron 2006\n). In \nArabidopsis\n, mutations of IRE1 lead to a short primary root phenotype (\nChen and Brandizzi 2012\n). Despite the high significance of the UPR in growth and development in multicellular eukaryotes, the regulatory connections between the UPR and other cellular responses remain unclear.\nBecause the hormone auxin has profound roles in most plant developmental processes, nucleus-based auxin signaling and plasma membrane (PM)-based intercellular auxin transport have been intensively studied. Three major classes of auxin signaling regulators exist in the nucleus: TIR1/AFB auxin co-receptors (\nDharmasiri \net al.\n 2005\n, \nGray \net al.\n 1999\n, \nKepinski and Leyser 2005\n), AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors (\nGray \net al.\n 2001\n), and ARF transcription factors (\nUlmasov \net al.\n 1997\n). To initiate the auxin response in the nucleus, TIR1/AFBs and auxin coordinately promote degradation of AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors. Consequently, ARFs are released from repression and activate the transcription of auxin responsive genes (\nDharmasiri \net al\n. 2005\n, \nGray, del Pozo \net al\n. 1999\n, \nKepinski and Leyser 2005\n).\nDirectional (polar) transport between cells is another crucial regulatory aspect of the auxin response. The auxin efflux carriers of the PIN family are the principal components of the polar auxin transport machinery (\nPetrasek \net al.\n 2006\n, \nWisniewska \net al.\n 2006\n). Based on protein topology and subcellular localization, PINs can be classified into PM- or ER-localized types (\nDal Bosco \net al.\n 2012\n, \nDing \net al.\n 2012\n, \nMravec \net al.\n 2009\n). While PM-based intercellular auxin transport has been considered the most critical point of regulation in the auxin response, it has recently been revealed that ER-based auxin regulation is also important. A putative auxin receptor, ABP1, and several auxin transporters (PIN5, PIN6, PIN8, and PILSs) have been shown to localize to the ER. The requirement of the ER-localized regulators in the auxin response underscores the existence of ER-based auxin biology (\nBarbez \net al.\n 2012\n, \nDal Bosco \net al\n. 2012\n, \nMravec \net al\n. 2009\n). Despite accumulating evidence that the ER is crucial for auxin regulation (\nFriml and Jones 2010\n), the physiological impact of ER-based auxin signaling is largely unknown.\nAs the UPR is critical for growth and development, we sought to identify the regulatory connection between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes. Given the central roles of auxin in numerous aspects of plant physiology, we hypothesized that the UPR regulates auxin signaling for coordinating secretory activities and physiological responses. Through biochemical, molecular biology, and genetic analyses, we demonstrate a connection between the UPR and auxin biology. Specifically, we show that ER stress negatively influences auxin signaling and that the ER-based auxin homoeostasis is important for UPR activation, supporting that the plant UPR alters auxin signaling to cope with ER stress. On the contrary, by establishing that IRE1 is required for the auxin responses, our work reveals that IRE1 has a specific role in hormonal signaling. The regulatory connections between the UPR and auxin biology revealed here hint that plants have evolved an organism-specific strategy to maintain balance between stress adaption and growth regulation.",
    "results": "ER stress alters the expression of auxin regulators\n\n\nTo examine whether ER stress modulates the transcription of auxin regulators, we monitored the expression of four auxin co-receptors: \nTIR1\n, \nAFB1\n, \nAFB2\n, and \nAFB3\n (\nTIR1\n/\nAFBs\n), under ER stress. The UPR was activated by inhibiting protein \nN\n-glycosylation using a classical ER stress inducer termed tunicamycin (Tm). \nArabidopsis\n seedlings were subjected to Tm for various periods of time, as adopted in established protocols (\nKoizumi \net al.\n 2001\n, \nMishiba \net al.\n 2013\n, \nNoh \net al.\n 2002\n). The transcriptional induction of UPR target genes is a molecular indication of UPR activation. To quantify the UPR activation levels, we monitored the transcription of classical UPR activation indicators, \nBiP1/2\n and \nPDI6\n over a 4-h time course of Tm treatment using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses (\nKamauchi \net al.\n 2005\n). \nBiP1\n/\n2\n is an ER chaperone essential for the UPR and a primary UPR target gene. \nPDI6\n encodes protein disulfide isomerase. Similar to BiP proteins, upregulation of PDI6 under ER stress contributes to increasing protein-folding capacity in the ER. RT-qPCR showed that both \nBiP1/2\n and \nPDI6\n were induced more than 2-fold at 0.5 h of Tm treatment and their levels increased over the time course of treatment (\nFigure S1\n). Interestingly, we found that there was a 20 to 55% percent reduction in the level of \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n transcripts 4 h after Tm treatment in wild-type Col-0 seedlings (\nFigure 1a\n). These results imply that ER stress negatively influences auxin signaling by repressing \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n transcripts. Since \nTIR1\n/\nAFBs\n activate the auxin response by promoting degradation of the AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors, we sought to determine whether the ER stress-induced repression of \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n transcripts resulted in the stabilization of AUX/IAA proteins. To do so, we conducted western blot analyses using transgenic \nArabidopsis\n plants expressing DII-VENUS, a fluorescently tagged auxin-interaction domain (DII) of AUX/IAAs that contains the canonical degron responsible for auxin- and TIR1/AFB-mediated protein degradation (\nBrunoud \net al.\n 2012\n). As the stabilization of AUX/IAAs is a downstream response of TIR1/AFB reduction, we examined DII-VENUS protein levels 6 h after Tm treatment. Indeed, immunoblot analyses showed that the protein levels of DII-VENUS increased in wild-type Col-0 roots under ER stress treatment (\nFigure 1b\n). Consistent with the western blot analysis results, a confocal microscopy approach revealed that DII-VENUS fluorescence levels, and therefore AUX/IAA protein levels, were consistently greater in roots challenged by the ER stress inducer than in mock-treated ones (\nFigure 1c\n). Together these observations support that ER stress leads to an increase in AUX/IAA levels, which is most likely a consequence of protein stabilization resulting from the down-regulation of \nTIR1\n/\nAFBs\n (\nFigure 1a\n).\n\n\nFigure 1. ER stress alters the expression of auxin regulators.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\n(a) RT-qPCR analyses of \nTIR1\n, \nAFB1\n, \nAFB2\n, and \nAFB3\n expression in ten-day-old Col-0 \nArabidopsis\n seedlings after treatment with 5 μg/ml Tm for 0.5, 1, or 4 h. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM) from three independent biological replicates. \nP\n-values were calculated by Student’s two-tailed t test against expression levels at 4 h relative to 0 h: \nTIR1\n (\nP\n = 0.00036), \nAFB1\n (\nP\n = 0.00041), \nAFB2\n (\nP\n = 0.00048), \nAFB3\n (\nP\n = 0.00032).\n\n\n(b) The levels of DII-VENUS fusion proteins increase upon exposure to ER stress. Ten-day-old DII-VENUS transgenic plants were treated with 5 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6 h. Proteins were extracted from root tissues and the fusion proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP serum (upper panel). Coomassie blue staining gel used as loading control (lower panel).\n\n\n(c) Ten-day-old transgenic plants expressing DII-VENUS were treated with 5 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6 h. Primary root tips were subjected to confocal microscopy analyses. Scale bars = 50 μm.\n\n\n(d) \nPIN\n mRNA levels decrease upon exposure to ER stress. RT-qPCR analyses of \nPIN\n family transcripts in ten-day-old wild-type Col-0 seedlings during treatment with 5 μg/ml Tm for 0.5, 1, or 4 h. Error bars represent SEM from three independent biological replicates. \nP\n-values were calculated against expression levels at 4 h relative to 0 h: \nPIN1\n (\nP\n = 0.00221), \nPIN2\n (\nP\n = 0.00316), \nPIN3\n (\nP\n = 5.4E-05), \nPIN4\n (\nP\n = 4.9E-05), \nPIN5\n (\nP\n = 6.4E-05), \nPIN6\n (\nP\n = 0.00012), \nPIN7\n (\nP\n = 0.00353). The transcriptional level of ETR1, an ER-associated ethylene receptor, was unchanged after treatment with Tm for 0.5, 1, or 4 h.\nNext, we investigated whether ER stress could control the transcription of auxin transporters. Using RT-qPCR analyses, we detected a 30–80% decrease in the mRNA levels of \nPIN1\n, \nPIN2\n, \nPIN3\n, \nPIN4\n, \nPIN5\n, \nPIN6\n, and \nPIN7\n in wild-type Col-0 seedlings during ER stress treatment (\nFigure 1d\n). In contrast, the transcriptional levels of an ER-associated ethylene receptor (ETR1), two ER-localized cytokinin receptors (AHK2 and AHK3), three nuclear protein (RAN2, ABH1, and FIB1), and two secretory proteins (VSR1 and SCAMP3) (\nAhmed \net al.\n 1997\n, \nChang \net al.\n 1993\n, \nKanneganti \net al.\n 2007\n, \nKierzkowski \net al.\n 2009\n, \nLaw \net al.\n 2012\n, \nMa \net al.\n 2007\n, \nWulfetange \net al.\n 2011\n) remained unchanged in ER stress conditions (\nFigure S2\n). Thus, we conclude that the Tm-induced decrease in the abundance of \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n and \nPIN\n transcripts is a specific cellular response. When ER stress was triggered by reduction of disulfide bond formation using dithiotreitol (DTT) treatment, similar down-regulation of \nTIR1/AFB\n and \nPIN\n transcripts was observed (\nFigure S3\n). Overall, these results show that ER stress specifically modulates the auxin response by repressing the transcription of auxin co-receptors and transporters.\n\n\nNext, we examined whether either IRE1 or TIR1/AFBs is essential for ER stress-induced down-regulation of auxin regulators. To do so, we performed the same ER stress treatment coupled with RT-qPCR analyses in an \natire1a atire1b\n double mutant and a \ntir1 afb1 afb2 afb3\n mutant (\nChen and Brandizzi 2012\n, \nDharmasiri \net al.\n 2005\n). In \natire1a atire1b\n, both \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n and \nPIN\n transcripts were still reduced under ER stress conditions (\nFigure 2a, b\n), similar to the decreased \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n and \nPIN\n transcripts pattern seen in wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 1a\n). The \nPIN\n transcripts also decreased under ER stress conditions in \ntir1 afb1 afb2 afb3\n mutant backgrounds (\nFigure 2b\n). However, with the exception of \nPIN7\n, in \natire1a atire1b\n the \nPIN\n and \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n transcription levels were further slightly reduced compared to wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 2c\n and \nS4\n). In contrast, the reduction of \nPIN1\n, \nPIN2\n, and \nPIN4\n transcript levels was larger in the \ntir1 afb1 afb2 afb3\n mutant compared to wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 2c\n). These data indicate that down-regulation of \nPIN\n transcripts on ER stress is partially and slightly affected by mutations of either IRE1 or TIR1/AFBs. These results further suggest that the \nIRE1\n and \nTIR1\n/\nAFBs\n play unessential but fine-tuning roles in ER stress-mediated repression of auxin regulators.\n\n\nFigure 2. IRE1 and TIR1/AFBs play fine-tuning roles in ER stress-induced down-regulation of auxin regulators.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\n(a) RT-qPCR analyses of \nTIR1\n, \nAFB1\n, \nAFB2\n, and \nAFB3\n expression in ten-day-old \natire1a atire1b\n (\nire1\n) \nArabidopsis\n seedlings after treatment with 5 μg/ml Tm for 0.5, 1, or 4 h.\n\n\n(b) \nPIN\n mRNA levels decrease upon exposure to ER stress in ten-day-old \nire1\n or \ntir1 afb1 afb2 afb3\n (\ntir1 afb\n).

Mammalian IRE1 controls multiple physiological responses under normal growth conditions. Our findings that auxin signaling is altered under ER stress hint that the UPR participates in the auxin response in plants. Although IRE1 is unessential for ER stress-triggered down-regulation of auxin regulators, we aimed to determine whether IRE1-dependent UPR is required for the auxin response without chemical induction of ER stress. Thus, we performed root inhibition assays to test the sensitivity of exogenous auxin application in \natire1a atire1b\n. To do so, \natire1a atire1b\n and wild-type Col-0 were germinated on medium containing a synthetic auxin analog, 1-naphthaleneacetic-acid (NAA), a naturally occurring auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), or an auxin transport inhibitor, 1-N-Naphthylphthalamic-acid (NPA). Interestingly, we found that \natire1a atire1b\n was significantly less sensitive to exogenously applied NAA, IAA, or NPA than wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 3a-c\n). The findings that \natire1a atire1b\n and wild-type Col-0 displayed comparable root-inhibition responses to three other plant hormone, jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene, indicate that the plant \nIRE1\n has a role specifically in the auxin response, as opposed to general hormones responses or growth regulation (\nFigure S5\n). To further confirm that AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B is involved in the auxin response, we investigated the transcriptional activation of auxin-responsive genes in \natire1a atire1b\n upon external application of auxin. RT-qPCR analyses showed that the transcriptional induction of five auxin-responsive genes, \nIAA3\n, \nIAA5\n, \nIAA19\n, \nIAA20\n, and \nGH3.6\n, was compromised after 2 and 4 h of NAA treatment in \natire1a atire1b\n relative to wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 3d\n and \nFigure S6a\n). The lower induction of auxin-responsive genes was repeatedly observed after both 1 and 2 h of IAA treatment (\nFigure S6b\n). These data further indicate that \natire1a atire1b\n exhibits an impaired response to exogenously applied auxin. The transcription of \nBiP1/2\n or \nPDI6\n was not significantly altered under IAA or NPA treatment in wild-type Col-0, suggesting that IAA or NPA treatment does not trigger ER stress like Tm treatment (\nFigure S7\n). Furthermore, we found that there was a 30% reduction in the free auxin level in roots of ten-day-old \natire1a atire1b\n plants compared to wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 3e\n). While IRE1 is required to maintain the free auxin level without ER stress treatment, the free auxin level remained unaffected within 4 h after Tm treatment (\nFigure S8\n). All together, these data support that plant \nIRE1\n is required for auxin response and homeostasis.\n\n\nFigure 3. \natire1a atire1b\n (\nire1\n) exhibits compromised auxin responses.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\n(a–c) In \nire1\n, root growth is largely resistant to treatments with auxin (NAA and IAA) or an auxin transport inhibitor (NPA).

To this end, we examined whether mutations in auxin signaling, polar transport, or biosynthesis affected the induction of UPR target genes. Intriguingly, we found that a mutation in \nPIN5\n or \nPIN6,\n two ER-localized auxin transporters, compromised UPR activation under ER stress. Compared to wild type, \npin5-5\n (\nMravec \net al\n. 2009\n) and \npin6-4\n (\nCazzonelli \net al.\n 2013\n) exhibited a 30–40% reduction in the level of \nBiP1/2\n and \nPDI6\n transcripts during ER stress treatment (\nFigure 4a\n and \nS9\n). These data imply that ER-based auxin homeostasis contributes to UPR regulation in plants. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that mutants of other types of ER-localized putative auxin transporters, \npils2-2\n, \npils5-2\n, and \npils2-2 pils5-2\n (\nBarbez \net al.\n 2012\n) exhibited similar defects in UPR activation (\nFigure 4a\n and \nS9\n). We found that the expression levels of \nBiP1/2\n and \nPDI6\n were comparable among wild-type Col-0 and the auxin mutants without ER stress treatment (\nFigure S10\n), supporting that the ER-localized auxin transporters are involved in ER stress-triggered UPR activation. In contrast, we found no significant differences in the induction of UPR target genes in mutants defective in either PM-localized auxin exporters, \npin1-1\n (\npin1\n), \neir1-1\n (\npin2\n), \npin3-4\n (\npin3\n), \npin4-3\n (\npin4\n)\n, pin7-2\n (\npin7\n)\n, pin3-5 pin4-3 pin7-1\n (\npin3 pin4 pin7\n)\n,\n an overexpressor of \nPIN1\n (\nOxPIN1\n), or the auxin importer \naux1-22\n (\naux1\n) compared to wild-type Col-0 under the same ER stress treatment conditions (\nOkada \net al.\n 1991\n, \nRoman \net al.\n, 1995\n, \nZádníková \net al.\n, 2010\n, \nFriml \net al.\n 2002\n, \nFriml \net al.\n 2003\n, \nSauer \net al.\n 2006\n, \nSwarup \net al.\n 2004\n) (\nFigure 4b\n). These results show that ER-based intracellular auxin transport, but not intercellular auxin transport, is required for the optimal UPR activation in plants.\n\n\nFigure 4.

Error bars represent SEM from three independent biological replicates.\nWe next investigated whether the ER-localized putative auxin receptor ABP1 and the auxin biosynthesis enzyme YUC were also involved in the UPR activation. Similar to the auxin mutants defective in ER-based transport, the \nabp1\n-\n5\n and \nYUC\n (\nXu \net al.\n 2010\n, \nZhao \net al.\n 2001\n) mutants also exhibited reduced levels in the activation of UPR target genes under ER stress (\nFigure 4a\n and \nS9\n). Conversely, the transcription levels of UPR target genes were higher in the \ntir1 afb1 afb2 afb3\n auxin co-receptor mutant than in wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 3a\n and \nS9\n), suggesting that TIR1/AFBs plays a negative role in UPR target gene induction. Altogether, these data highlight that the ER-based regulation of auxin homeostasis may operate as a molecular link between the UPR and other cellular processes.\npin5\n enhances the \nire1\n phenotype in auxin responses and UPR activation\n\n\nTo investigate a functional relationship of IRE1 and PIN5 in the UPR and auxin response\n,\n we generated an \natire1a atire1b pin5\n triple mutant and performed phenotypic analyses. Consistent with previous reports, \natire1a atire1b\n and \npin5-5\n displayed a short primary root phenotype (\nChen and Brandizzi 2012\n, \nMravec \net al.\n 2009\n). We found that the roots of the \natire1a atire1b pin5\n triple mutant were significantly shorter than those of \natire1a atire1b\n or \npin5-5\n (\nFigure 5a\n). However, \natire1a atire1b\n, \npin5-5\n, and \natire1a atire1b pin5\n showed comparable lateral root density and hypocotyl length to wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure S11\n), suggesting that the IRE1 and PIN5 have a role specifically in regulation of primary root elongation. In addition, \natire1a atire1b pin5\n also displayed lower free auxin levels compared to \natire1a atire1b\n or \npin5-5\n (\nFig 5b\n). Specifically, compared to wild-type Col-0, the roots of \npin5-5\n and \natire1a atire1b\n exhibited a 15 and 30% reduction in free auxin levels, respectively. Nonetheless, the roots of \natire1a atire1b pin5\n displayed a 45% reduction in free auxin level (\nFigure 5b\n). Finally, in agreement with previous findings (\nMravec \net al.\n 2009\n), root inhibition assays showed that \npin5-5\n was less sensitive than wild-type Col-0 to low concentrations of IAA but displayed a normal response to NAA, NPA, or high concentrations of IAA (\nMravec \net al.\n 2009\n). Intriguingly, the \natire1a atire1b pin5\n mutant was significantly less sensitive than \natire1a atire1b\n to all three treatments (\nFigure 5c-e\n). A comparable root-inhibition response to JA, ABA, and ethylene in \natire1a atire1b pin5\n indicated that the genetic interaction between IRE1 and PIN5 is specific to the auxin response (\nFigure S5\n).\n\n\nFigure 5. \npin5\n enhances the auxin and ER stress response phenotype in \natire1a atire1b\n (\nire1\n).\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\n(a) \npin5-5\n (\npin5\n) enhances the short root phenotype of \nire1\n.

Altogether, our results imply that regulation of ER-based auxin homeostasis is part of ER stress adaptive mechanisms that plants have evolved to parallel the classical UPR signaling pathways.",
    "er_stress_alters_the_expression_of_auxin_regulators": "To examine whether ER stress modulates the transcription of auxin regulators, we monitored the expression of four auxin co-receptors: \nTIR1\n, \nAFB1\n, \nAFB2\n, and \nAFB3\n (\nTIR1\n/\nAFBs\n), under ER stress. The UPR was activated by inhibiting protein \nN\n-glycosylation using a classical ER stress inducer termed tunicamycin (Tm). \nArabidopsis\n seedlings were subjected to Tm for various periods of time, as adopted in established protocols (\nKoizumi \net al.\n 2001\n, \nMishiba \net al.\n 2013\n, \nNoh \net al.\n 2002\n). The transcriptional induction of UPR target genes is a molecular indication of UPR activation. To quantify the UPR activation levels, we monitored the transcription of classical UPR activation indicators, \nBiP1/2\n and \nPDI6\n over a 4-h time course of Tm treatment using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses (\nKamauchi \net al.\n 2005\n). \nBiP1\n/\n2\n is an ER chaperone essential for the UPR and a primary UPR target gene. \nPDI6\n encodes protein disulfide isomerase. Similar to BiP proteins, upregulation of PDI6 under ER stress contributes to increasing protein-folding capacity in the ER. RT-qPCR showed that both \nBiP1/2\n and \nPDI6\n were induced more than 2-fold at 0.5 h of Tm treatment and their levels increased over the time course of treatment (\nFigure S1\n). Interestingly, we found that there was a 20 to 55% percent reduction in the level of \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n transcripts 4 h after Tm treatment in wild-type Col-0 seedlings (\nFigure 1a\n). These results imply that ER stress negatively influences auxin signaling by repressing \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n transcripts. Since \nTIR1\n/\nAFBs\n activate the auxin response by promoting degradation of the AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors, we sought to determine whether the ER stress-induced repression of \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n transcripts resulted in the stabilization of AUX/IAA proteins. To do so, we conducted western blot analyses using transgenic \nArabidopsis\n plants expressing DII-VENUS, a fluorescently tagged auxin-interaction domain (DII) of AUX/IAAs that contains the canonical degron responsible for auxin- and TIR1/AFB-mediated protein degradation (\nBrunoud \net al.\n 2012\n). As the stabilization of AUX/IAAs is a downstream response of TIR1/AFB reduction, we examined DII-VENUS protein levels 6 h after Tm treatment. Indeed, immunoblot analyses showed that the protein levels of DII-VENUS increased in wild-type Col-0 roots under ER stress treatment (\nFigure 1b\n). Consistent with the western blot analysis results, a confocal microscopy approach revealed that DII-VENUS fluorescence levels, and therefore AUX/IAA protein levels, were consistently greater in roots challenged by the ER stress inducer than in mock-treated ones (\nFigure 1c\n). Together these observations support that ER stress leads to an increase in AUX/IAA levels, which is most likely a consequence of protein stabilization resulting from the down-regulation of \nTIR1\n/\nAFBs\n (\nFigure 1a\n).\nFigure 1.

Error bars represent SEM from three independent biological replicates. \nP\n-values were calculated against expression levels at 4 h relative to 0 h: \nPIN1\n (\nP\n = 0.00221), \nPIN2\n (\nP\n = 0.00316), \nPIN3\n (\nP\n = 5.4E-05), \nPIN4\n (\nP\n = 4.9E-05), \nPIN5\n (\nP\n = 6.4E-05), \nPIN6\n (\nP\n = 0.00012), \nPIN7\n (\nP\n = 0.00353). The transcriptional level of ETR1, an ER-associated ethylene receptor, was unchanged after treatment with Tm for 0.5, 1, or 4 h.\nNext, we investigated whether ER stress could control the transcription of auxin transporters. Using RT-qPCR analyses, we detected a 30–80% decrease in the mRNA levels of \nPIN1\n, \nPIN2\n, \nPIN3\n, \nPIN4\n, \nPIN5\n, \nPIN6\n, and \nPIN7\n in wild-type Col-0 seedlings during ER stress treatment (\nFigure 1d\n). In contrast, the transcriptional levels of an ER-associated ethylene receptor (ETR1), two ER-localized cytokinin receptors (AHK2 and AHK3), three nuclear protein (RAN2, ABH1, and FIB1), and two secretory proteins (VSR1 and SCAMP3) (\nAhmed \net al.\n 1997\n, \nChang \net al.\n 1993\n, \nKanneganti \net al.\n 2007\n, \nKierzkowski \net al.\n 2009\n, \nLaw \net al.\n 2012\n, \nMa \net al.\n 2007\n, \nWulfetange \net al.\n 2011\n) remained unchanged in ER stress conditions (\nFigure S2\n). Thus, we conclude that the Tm-induced decrease in the abundance of \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n and \nPIN\n transcripts is a specific cellular response. When ER stress was triggered by reduction of disulfide bond formation using dithiotreitol (DTT) treatment, similar down-regulation of \nTIR1/AFB\n and \nPIN\n transcripts was observed (\nFigure S3\n). Overall, these results show that ER stress specifically modulates the auxin response by repressing the transcription of auxin co-receptors and transporters.\nNext, we examined whether either IRE1 or TIR1/AFBs is essential for ER stress-induced down-regulation of auxin regulators. To do so, we performed the same ER stress treatment coupled with RT-qPCR analyses in an \natire1a atire1b\n double mutant and a \ntir1 afb1 afb2 afb3\n mutant (\nChen and Brandizzi 2012\n, \nDharmasiri \net al.\n 2005\n). In \natire1a atire1b\n, both \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n and \nPIN\n transcripts were still reduced under ER stress conditions (\nFigure 2a, b\n), similar to the decreased \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n and \nPIN\n transcripts pattern seen in wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 1a\n). The \nPIN\n transcripts also decreased under ER stress conditions in \ntir1 afb1 afb2 afb3\n mutant backgrounds (\nFigure 2b\n). However, with the exception of \nPIN7\n, in \natire1a atire1b\n the \nPIN\n and \nTIR1\n/\nAFB\n transcription levels were further slightly reduced compared to wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 2c\n and \nS4\n). In contrast, the reduction of \nPIN1\n, \nPIN2\n, and \nPIN4\n transcript levels was larger in the \ntir1 afb1 afb2 afb3\n mutant compared to wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 2c\n). These data indicate that down-regulation of \nPIN\n transcripts on ER stress is partially and slightly affected by mutations of either IRE1 or TIR1/AFBs. These results further suggest that the \nIRE1\n and \nTIR1\n/\nAFBs\n play unessential but fine-tuning roles in ER stress-mediated repression of auxin regulators.\nFigure 2.

    "ire1_is_required_for_auxin_response_and_homeostasis": "While the UPR is necessary for growth and development, the manner by which the UPR influences other cellular regulatory processes is largely unknown. Mammalian IRE1 controls multiple physiological responses under normal growth conditions. Our findings that auxin signaling is altered under ER stress hint that the UPR participates in the auxin response in plants. Although IRE1 is unessential for ER stress-triggered down-regulation of auxin regulators, we aimed to determine whether IRE1-dependent UPR is required for the auxin response without chemical induction of ER stress. Thus, we performed root inhibition assays to test the sensitivity of exogenous auxin application in \natire1a atire1b\n. To do so, \natire1a atire1b\n and wild-type Col-0 were germinated on medium containing a synthetic auxin analog, 1-naphthaleneacetic-acid (NAA), a naturally occurring auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), or an auxin transport inhibitor, 1-N-Naphthylphthalamic-acid (NPA). Interestingly, we found that \natire1a atire1b\n was significantly less sensitive to exogenously applied NAA, IAA, or NPA than wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 3a-c\n). The findings that \natire1a atire1b\n and wild-type Col-0 displayed comparable root-inhibition responses to three other plant hormone, jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene, indicate that the plant \nIRE1\n has a role specifically in the auxin response, as opposed to general hormones responses or growth regulation (\nFigure S5\n). To further confirm that AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B is involved in the auxin response, we investigated the transcriptional activation of auxin-responsive genes in \natire1a atire1b\n upon external application of auxin. RT-qPCR analyses showed that the transcriptional induction of five auxin-responsive genes, \nIAA3\n, \nIAA5\n, \nIAA19\n, \nIAA20\n, and \nGH3.6\n, was compromised after 2 and 4 h of NAA treatment in \natire1a atire1b\n relative to wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 3d\n and \nFigure S6a\n). The lower induction of auxin-responsive genes was repeatedly observed after both 1 and 2 h of IAA treatment (\nFigure S6b\n). These data further indicate that \natire1a atire1b\n exhibits an impaired response to exogenously applied auxin. The transcription of \nBiP1/2\n or \nPDI6\n was not significantly altered under IAA or NPA treatment in wild-type Col-0, suggesting that IAA or NPA treatment does not trigger ER stress like Tm treatment (\nFigure S7\n). Furthermore, we found that there was a 30% reduction in the free auxin level in roots of ten-day-old \natire1a atire1b\n plants compared to wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure 3e\n). While IRE1 is required to maintain the free auxin level without ER stress treatment, the free auxin level remained unaffected within 4 h after Tm treatment (\nFigure S8\n).

Consistent with previous reports, \natire1a atire1b\n and \npin5-5\n displayed a short primary root phenotype (\nChen and Brandizzi 2012\n, \nMravec \net al.\n 2009\n).

However, \natire1a atire1b\n, \npin5-5\n, and \natire1a atire1b pin5\n showed comparable lateral root density and hypocotyl length to wild-type Col-0 (\nFigure S11\n), suggesting that the IRE1 and PIN5 have a role specifically in regulation of primary root elongation. In addition, \natire1a atire1b pin5\n also displayed lower free auxin levels compared to \natire1a atire1b\n or \npin5-5\n (\nFig 5b\n). Specifically, compared to wild-type Col-0, the roots of \npin5-5\n and \natire1a atire1b\n exhibited a 15 and 30% reduction in free auxin levels, respectively. Nonetheless, the roots of \natire1a atire1b pin5\n displayed a 45% reduction in free auxin level (\nFigure 5b\n). Finally, in agreement with previous findings (\nMravec \net al.\n 2009\n), root inhibition assays showed that \npin5-5\n was less sensitive than wild-type Col-0 to low concentrations of IAA but displayed a normal response to NAA, NPA, or high concentrations of IAA (\nMravec \net al.\n 2009\n).

    "discussion": "Our findings uncover an unpredicted but critical regulatory relationship between two fundamental signaling pathways in plants, the UPR and auxin response. Studies of the mammalian UPR indicate that distinct UPR signaling pathways mediate specific physiological processes (\nWu and Kaufman 2006\n). While the \nIRE1\n-dependent mRNA splicing event is the most evolutionarily conserved UPR pathway in eukaryotes, \nIRE1\n has also evolved specific functions in multicellular organisms to associate the UPR with more complex physiological processes (\nHetz \net al.\n 2006\n, \nUrano \net al.\n 2000\n). Nevertheless, our understanding of the connection between the UPR and other cellular processes is still in its infancy. Here, we have defined a plant-specific regulatory role for \nIRE1\n in the auxin response. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that IRE1 regulates auxin response independently from the classical UPR, it is plausible that IRE1-dependent UPR signaling is involved in auxin transport. The auxin transport is one of the most crucial regulatory mechanisms in the auxin biology. As most regulatory components of the auxin transport system are secretory proteins, we speculate that the \nIRE1\n-dependent UPR signaling maintains a robust and efficient membrane trafficking system for the supply of functional auxin regulators. The identification of auxin regulators directly controlled by IRE1 will elucidate how IRE1 modulates specific aspects of auxin biology to coordinate the secretory pathway with physiological responses. Together with the involvement of UPR-specific membrane tethered transcription factors in brassinosteroid signaling (\nChe \net al.\n 2010\n), our results support the significance of the plant UPR in hormone signaling.\nIRE1 regulates the UPR through various mechanisms including unconventional splicing, RNA decay, and protein-protein interaction. It has recently been reported that similar to its mammalian counterpart, plant IRE1 controls gene expression through RNA decay in addition of splicing bZIP60 transcription factor (\nMishiba \net al.\n 2013\n). Mammalian IRE1 operates RNA decay to trigger diverse UPR signaling pathways. It would be interesting to test whether plant IRE1 also relies on its RNA decay function for the auxin response. If IRE1-dependent RNA decay contributes at least partially to the regulation of auxin signaling on ER stress, it would represent a specific regulatory event of the UPR as opposed to random RNA decay under stress. Notably, we have established that IRE1 is required for the optimal auxin response under exogenously applied auxin (\nFigure 3\n and \n6a\n), but plays only partial role in ER stress-induced down-regulation of auxin regulators (\nFigure 2\n). These findings support that distinct mechanisms regulate auxin signaling under various conditions to achieve context-specific auxin responses.\nFigure 6. Working model.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\n(a) IRE1 is required for the auxin responses upon external auxin application. IRE1, ER- and PM-localized PINs are involved in the maintenance of auxin homeostasis without chemical induction of ER stress.\n\n\n(b) ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin receptors TIR1/AFBs, ER- and PM-localized PINs. IRE1 and ER-localized PINs are required for the optimal induction of UPR target genes.\nWe have established that only ER-localized auxin transporters, but not PM-localized auxin exporters or importers, are required for the optimal UPR activation (\nFigure 6b\n). Studies of ER-localized auxin regulators suggest that a distinct auxin signaling pathway exists in the ER (\nFriml and Jones 2010\n). Accordingly, we propose that ER-based auxin signaling actively transports free auxin through the ER membranes to modulate the signaling response in the nucleus. More specifically, plant cells can transmit signals between sub-cellular compartments by adjusting the free auxin level in the ER, cytosol, and nucleus. We thus propose a previously uncharacterized cellular function for auxin as a signaling molecule that connects subcellular compartments and maintains cellular homeostasis in plants. It has long been believed that intercellular polar auxin transport is the key regulatory component of the auxin response; however, the biological significance of intracellular auxin transport has been overlooked. Our findings support a specific cellular function of ER-based intracellular auxin distribution in the UPR activation, and thus emphasize the importance of ER auxin biology in plant physiology.\nWe have shown that ER-localized auxin transporters have a role in the UPR activation. A plausible hypothesis to explain this is that the auxin levels in the ER lumen contribute to UPR activation on ER stress. Namely, ER-localized auxin transporters or their associated proteins might sense ER stress and rapidly adjust auxin levels in the ER lumen. The consequent fluctuation of auxin levels in the ER could in turn affect the magnitude of UPR activation. Nevertheless, because a mutation of PIN5 enhances the \natire1a atire1b\n mutant phenotype in the UPR activation (\nFigure 5f\n), PIN5-dependent regulation of auxin levels under ER stress does not completely rely on IRE1. Whether ER-localized auxin transporters can directly monitor ER stress or indirectly sense ER stress-related cellular homeostasis is yet to be established; however, the findings presented here support that ER-localized transporters play a role in the UPR activation. Once a reliable system to monitor auxin levels in the ER lumen is developed, it will be interesting to experimentally confirm that ER-localized transporters mediate auxin transport between ER lumen and cytosol on ER stress.\nPIN5 has been proposed to play a unique role in the auxin response since its transcriptional regulation and regulatory mechanisms appear to be different from PM-localized PINs. It was reported that the transcription of PIN5 is decreased under exogenous application of auxin although PIN5 is required for the auxin response (\nMravec \net al.\n 2009\n). Likewise, our study also showed that ER stress induces a decrease in the transcription of PIN5 while PIN5 is required for the optimal induction of UPR activation. As the PIN5 protein levels have not been monitored under auxin or ER stress treatment, one possibility is that the down-regulation of PIN5 transcript represents a feedback regulatory mechanism. Namely, the cellular availability or the activity of PIN5 may be increased in response to ER stress (e.g. by protein stabilization events or post-translational modifications). This in turn may cause reduction of PIN5 transcriptional levels to safeguard cellular auxin homeostasis. Another possibility is that ER stress represses general auxin responses including inter- and intra-cellular auxin transport to optimize cellular responses to cope with stress. Thus, both PM- and ER-localized transporter are down-regulated under ER stress; however, a basal level of ER-localized transporters may be still required for optimal induction of UPR target gene as they might be involved in stress signal transmission through transport the auxin between subcellular compartments. Thus, mutants of ER-localized auxin regulators would display a compromised UPR activation. Further experimental evidences are needed to verify the possibilities. Nonetheless, our data support that regulation of PIN5 transcripts is a mechanism to maintain PIN5-related cellular homeostasis. Also, \npin5-5\n was shown to have a higher free auxin levels (\nMravec \net al.\n 2009\n) but we found that \npin5-5\n displayed lower free auxin level. This is possibly because unlike Mravec \net al\n, which used intact seedlings, we used only root tissues in the free auxin level assay. Future comprehensive quantification analyses of free auxin levels in various tissues will likely reveal whether PIN5 regulates auxin distribution among tissues.\nThe molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional down-regulation of auxin receptors and transporters on ER stress are still unknown. Whether UPR regulators can directly control transcription of auxin receptors and transporters or ER stress-dependent cellular responses mediate auxin homeostasis in a manner independent of classical UPR regulation awaits further validation.\nIn contrast to animals, plants, as sessile organisms, have an extraordinary plasticity in post-embryonic development, responding to both internal and external cues. Nonetheless, our understanding of how plants integrate developmental and environmental signals to balance growth and adaptive regulation is limited. The inter-regulation between the UPR and auxin response demonstrated in this study opens a new area of investigation in plant physiology. Given the essential roles of the UPR in multiple stresses adaptation, the integrated action of the UPR and auxin response highlights a plant-specific strategy that evolved to maintain the crucial balance between stress response and growth regulation for ultimate fitness.",
