    "abstract": "The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here, we employ an \nArabidopsis thaliana\n mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene \nWUSCHEL\n. Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4. These results are consistent with a model wherein the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex.\nKEY WORDS:\n \nArabidopsis thaliana\n, Cytokinin, Plastid, Reactive oxygen species, Retrograde signaling, Shoot apical meristem",
    "introduction": "The development of land plants provides a unique opportunity to study how cell differentiation is determined, as plant cell identity is highly plastic (\nGaillochet and Lohmann, 2015\n). A classic illustration of plant cell pluripotency is the ability to produce a mass of undifferentiated cells referred to as callus. In nature, callus production is triggered by wounding or exposure to pathogens (\nIkeuchi et al., 2013\n). In the laboratory, callus is typically induced by exogenous treatment with two phytohormones, cytokinin (CK) and auxin (\nSkoog and Miller, 1957\n).\nCallus is frequently derived from meristem or meristem-like cells (\nJiang et al., 2015\n; \nSugimoto et al., 2011\n). Meristems are small self-renewing pools of undifferentiated cells from which new organs are derived as the plant grows (\nAichinger et al., 2012\n; \nGaillochet and Lohmann, 2015\n). Above ground, the maintenance and regulation of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is crucial for the proper specification and positioning of leaves (\nBarton, 2010\n). SAM identity requires both the imposition of stem cell fate by the WUSCHEL (WUS)/CLAVATA (CLV) signaling circuit (\nFletcher et al., 1999\n; \nSchoof et al., 2000\n) and the suppression of differentiation by SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) (\nEndrizzi et al., 1996\n; \nLong et al., 1996\n).\nCK plays a key role in the function of the SAM. In the central zone (CZ), CK promotes proliferation, while auxin promotes differentiation in the peripheral zone (PZ) (\nSchaller et al., 2015\n). Localized CK perception and response specifies the organizing center of the SAM, also the region of \nWUS\n expression (\nChickarmane et al., 2012\n; \nGordon et al., 2009\n; \nZurcher et al., 2013\n). WUS activity maintains itself through a positive feedback loop involving the CK response via type-A \nArabidopsis\n response regulators (ARRs), key negative regulators of CK signaling (\nLeibfried et al., 2005\n; \nSchuster et al., 2014\n; \nTo et al., 2007\n; \nZhao et al., 2010\n). In the SAM, auxin acts to repress \nARR7\n and \nARR15\n, (\nZhao et al., 2010\n). Thus, auxin and CK synergize to regulate the core WUS/CLV pathway, maintaining a balance between differentiation and proliferation in the SAM (\nGaillochet and Lohmann, 2015\n; \nIkeuchi et al., 2013\n).\nShoot development also depends on plastids, which are endosymbiotic organelles responsible for photosynthesis, amino acid, starch and fatty acid biosynthesis, and the production of many hormones and secondary metabolites (\nNeuhaus and Emes, 2000\n). As cells leave the SAM and take on the appropriate cell identity within leaf primordia, the small, undifferentiated plastids – called proplastids – inside them must also differentiate, usually into chloroplasts. Many mutants lacking functional plastid-localized proteins exhibit secondary defects in leaf cell specification (\nLarkin, 2014\n; \nLuesse et al., 2015\n; \nMoschopoulos et al., 2012\n), providing genetic evidence that normal leaf development depends upon plastid homeostasis. The integration of plastid differentiation into the process of development probably requires tightly regulated and finely tuned two-way communication between the plastid and the nucleus, including both anterograde (nucleus-to-plastid) and retrograde (plastid-to-nucleus) signaling. An increasing number of overlapping retrograde signaling pathways that are triggered by developmental or environmental defects in plastid function have been identified (\nChan et al., 201\n6; \nWoodson and Chory, 2012\n). Numerous retrograde signals have been proposed, including intermediates in isoprenoid (\nXiao et al., 2012\n) biosynthesis, heme (\nWoodson et al., 2011\n), phosphonucleotides (\nEstavillo et al., 2011\n), reactive oxygen species (ROS) (\nWagner et al., 2004\n) and oxidized carotenoids (\nRamel et al., 2012\n). Despite the diversity, all these pathways and signals link a disruption in plastid homeostasis to altered nuclear gene expression (\nChan et al., 201\n6).\nOne retrograde signaling pathway that may serve to connect plastid signals to shoot development is the GENOMES UNCOUPLED (GUN1)/ABA-INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4) pathway (\nFernandez and Strand, 2008\n; \nLeon et al., 2012\n). ABI4 is a nuclear transcription factor involved in many plant developmental pathways, including the response to ABA, sugar signaling, and mitochondrial retrograde signaling (\nLeon et al., 2012\n). GUN1 is a plastid protein of unclear molecular function that is thought to act with ABI4 in at least two retrograde signaling pathways: one that coordinates plastid and nuclear gene expression during development, and one that respond to defects in chlorophyll biosynthesis (\nCottage et al., 2010\n; \nKoussevitzky et al., 2007\n; \nSun et al., 2011\n).\nWe have been using an \nArabidopsis\n mutant with constitutively osmotically stressed plastids [\nmsl2 msl3\n (\nVeley et al., 2012\n)] as a model system to address the developmental effects of plastid dysfunction. MSL2 and MSL3 are two members of the MscS-Like (MSL) family of mechanosensitive ion channels that localize to the plastid envelope and are required for normal plastid size, shape and division site selection (\nHaswell and Meyerowitz, 2006\n; \nWilson et al., 2011\n). By analogy to family members in bacteria (\nLevina et al., 1999\n) and plants (\nHamilton et al., 2015\n) and based on \nin vivo\n experiments (\nVeley et al., 2012\n), MSL2 and MSL3 are likely to serve as osmotic ‘safety valves’, allowing plastids to continuously maintain osmotic homeostasis during normal growth and development. In addition, \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant plants exhibit small stature, variegated leaf color and ruffled leaf margins. These whole-plant defects can be attributed to plastid osmotic stress, as they are suppressed by environmental and genetic manipulations that increase cytoplasmic osmolarity and draw water out of the plastid (\nVeley et al., 2012\n; \nWilson et al., 2014\n). Here, we report a new and unexpected phenotype associated with \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants, and establish the molecular and genetic pathways that underlie it.",
    "results": "msl2 msl3\n double mutants develop callus at the shoot apex\n\n\nWhen grown on solid medium for over 14 days, \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutant plants developed a proliferating mass of undifferentiated cells, or callus, at the apex of the plant (\nFig. 1\nA-D). A single mass at the center of the apex, twin masses associated with the cotyledon petioles or, occasionally, three masses were observed (\nFig. 1\nA-C). New green tissue was frequently observed growing out of the apical callus (white arrow, \nFig. 1\nD). This phenotype was not observed in soil-grown plants.\n\n\n\nFig. 1.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nmsl2 msl3\n double mutants develop callus at the shoot apex.\n (A-D) Bright-field images of 21-day-old \nmsl2 msl3\n seedlings grown on solid medium.

(I-L) Close-up images of individual seedlings shown in (G) grown without NaCl (I) or transferred to NaCl plates at 2 (J), 5 (K), or 7 (L) DAG. (M) Bright-field images of 14-day-old \nmsl2 msl3\n seedlings harboring the \nMSL2\n transgene (\nMSL2g\n) or \nMSL2\n under the control of the \nSCR\n promoter. Scale bars: 1 mm (A-E), 5 mm (G,M) and 2.5 mm (I-L).\nMasses of callus tissue were apparent to the naked eye at the apex of \nmsl2 msl3\n seedlings between 14 and 16 days after germination (DAG) and continued to grow in size to 22 DAG (\nFig. 1\nE, second row from top). As previously documented (\nHaswell and Meyerowitz, 2006\n; \nJensen and Haswell, 2012\n; \nWilson et al., 2014\n), \nmsl2 msl3\n leaves were small and malformed. To facilitate comparison, the same leaf from each genotype is marked with an asterisk in the time course in \nFig. 1\nE. The percentage of \nmsl2 msl3\n seedlings with callus increased to ∼82% by 21 DAG (\nFig. 1\nF); callus was not observed in any wild-type plants at any developmental stage.\n\n\nWe previously showed that growth on medium containing increased levels of osmolytes (sugars or salt) suppressed the plastid morphology and leaf development phenotypes of \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants, probably by increasing cytoplasmic osmolarity and reducing plastid hypo-osmotic stress (\nVeley et al., 2012\n; \nWilson et al., 2014\n). To determine if the same was true for callus formation, and to assess the dependence of suppression on age and developmental stage, seedlings were germinated on MS solid medium and transferred to medium containing 82 mM NaCl at 2, 5, 7, or 9 DAG and assessed at 21 DAG for callus formation and leaf development. Full suppression of callus formation and abnormal leaf development was only observed in seedlings transferred to solid medium containing NaCl from MS at 2 DAG (\nFig. 1\nG-L), establishing a small developmental window after which alleviation of plastid hypo-osmotic stress can no longer suppress leaf morphology defects and apical callus production in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants. Suppression was also observed when seedlings were grown on medium containing sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol, indicating that the effect is osmotic (\nFig. S1A\n). The converse experiment, in which seedlings were transferred from salt-containing medium to normal MS showed that plastid osmotic homoeostasis is continuously required to maintain normal leaf development (\nFig. 1\nG,H and \nFig. S1B\n).\nMSL2 function is required in the SAM or leaf primordia to prevent callus production\n\n\nTo determine if MSL2 expression in the SAM and leaf primordia is required to prevent callus production in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background, we examined apical callus production in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant plants expressing \nMSL2\n from the \nSCARECROW\n (\nSCR\n) promoter, which is expressed in the L1 cell layer of the meristem and leaf primordia (\nWysocka-Diller et al., 2000\n). As shown in \nFig. 1\nM, apical callus formation was fully suppressed in T2 \nmsl2 msl3 SCRpMSL2\n lines. Although these plants developed multiple sets of developmentally normal true leaves, the majority of T2 lines examined exhibited reduced stature.\nCells and plastids at the apex of young \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants are morphologically abnormal\n\n\nCloser examination of the apex of young (4-day-old) \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant seedlings revealed a cluster of disorganized and heterologously shaped cells at the expected location of the SAM (\nFig. 2\nA). Most cells within the cluster contained large, spherical, clear entities. In comparison, the SAM cells of a wild-type seedling were organized into cell layers and had small vacuoles. We next used transmission electron microscopy to further characterize the morphology of developing chloroplasts and proplastids in the SAM and surrounding tissue of \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant seedlings (\nFig. 2\nB). In the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant, young chloroplasts were enlarged, lacked the lens shape of wild-type chloroplasts and exhibited a disorganized developing thylakoid network (\nFig. 2\nB,D and \nFig. S2B\n). In agreement with previous reports (\nCharuvi et al., 2012\n), wild-type proplastids appeared as small structures (0.5-1 µm in diameter) containing rudimentary thylakoid networks of varying developmental stages, plastoglobules and double membranes (\nFig. 2\nE and \nFig. S2A\n). However, in the SAM of \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants, entities with these established features had decreased stromal density and were greatly enlarged compared with the wild type (asterisks in \nFig. 2\nA and \nFig. S2B\n, \nFig. 2\nF). Many exceeded 5 µm in diameter. All were clearly bound by a double membrane (white arrow, \nFig. 2\nG and \nFig. S2C,D\n). These data show that the greatly enlarged phenotype of non-green plastids of the leaf epidermis (\nHaswell and Meyerowitz, 2006\n; \nVeley et al., 2012\n) extends to proplastids of the SAM.\n\n\n\nFig. 2.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nFour-day-old \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants exhibit abnormal cellular organization and plastids at the SAM.\n (A) Phase contrast images of the SAM region of seedlings of the indicated genotypes. (B-G) Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant SAM (B) and developing chloroplasts (C-D) and proplastids (E-F) in wild-type and \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant seedlings. (G) Magnified region of \nmsl2 msl3\n plastid envelope, indicated by box in F. Examples of proplastids and developing chloroplasts are indicated in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant by asterisks and black arrowheads, respectively. Plastoglobules (PG), double membrane (white arrowheads) and thylakoids (double black arrowheads) are indicated. Scale bars: 50 µm (A), 10 µm (B-D), 1 µm (F) and 100 nm (E,G).\nCallus produced in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants is associated with an altered cytokinin to auxin ratio and requires CK perception\n\n\nThe production of shooty callus has been associated with increased production or availability of CKs and an imbalance in the cytokinin:auxin ratio (\nFrank et al., 2002\n, \n2000\n; \nLee et al., 2004\n). Consistent with these observations, apical callus production, dwarfing and leaf phenotypes of the \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutant were strongly suppressed when seedlings were grown on medium with the synthetic auxin 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) (\nFig. 3\nA,C). The leaf epidermis of \nmsl2 msl3\n seedlings contain grossly enlarged and round non-green plastids, as visualized with the fluorescent plastid marker RecA-dsRED (\nHaswell and Meyerowitz, 2006\n; \nVeley et al., 2012\n; \nWilson et al., 2014\n). This phenotype was not altered by growth on 2 µM NAA (\nFig. 3\nB), indicating that NAA treatment suppresses callus formation downstream of effects on plastid morphology. In agreement with previous data, growth on medium supplemented with salt fully suppressed the plastid morphology defects (\nVeley et al., 2012\n). Trans-zeatin-riboside levels were increased ∼6.5-fold in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant seedlings compared with the wild type, but IAA levels were not significantly changed (\nFig. 3\nD).\n\n\n\nFig. 3.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nCallus produced in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants is associated with increased CK production and requires CK signaling.\n (A) Seedlings grown for 21 days on solid medium containing the indicated concentration of NAA.

Scale bars: 1 mm (A,E), 10 µm (B).\nARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE 2\n (\nAHK2\n) encodes one of three related histidine kinases known to function as CK receptors in \nArabidopsis\n (\nUeguchi et al., 2001\n; \nYamada et al., 2001\n) and an \nAHK2\n loss-of-function mutant, \nahk2-2\n (\nHiguchi et al., 2004\n) is impaired in CK-induced upregulation of \nWUS\n (\nGordon et al., 2009\n). Two independently isolated \nmsl2 msl3 ahk2-2\n triple mutants showed a significant reduction in apical callus formation, with less than 40% of seedlings developing callus (\nFig. 3\nF). However, the \nmsl2 msl3 ahk2-2\n triple mutants were similar to the \nmsl2 msl3\n double with respect to the leaf developmental defect (\nFig. 3\nE). Incomplete suppression may be due to redundancy among CK receptors (\nGordon et al., 2009\n), or callus formation and leaf morphology defects may be produced through different pathways.\n\n\nTo determine if feedback loops involving \nWUS\n, ARR genes (\nGordon et al., 2009\n; \nSchuster et al., 2014\n), or the meristem identity gene \nSTM\n (\nScofield et al., 2013\n) were misregulated in \nmsl2 msl3\n seedlings, quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine transcript levels in the aerial tissue of 7- and 21-day-old seedlings (\nFig. 3\nG). In \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant seedlings \nWUS\n transcript levels were upregulated 5.3-fold compared with the wild type by 7 DAG (prior to visible callus development, \nFig. 1\nE); and 4-fold by 21 DAG. \nSTM\n expression levels were upregulated 2.1-fold in 7-day-old \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants, but were not distinguishable from the wild type at 21 DAG. Consistent with previous observations that they inhibit callus formation (\nBuechel et al., 2010\n; \nLiu et al., 2016\n), \nARR7\n and \nARR15\n transcript levels were reduced in both 7- and 21-day-old \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant seedlings compared with the wild type, exhibiting 43-55% and 13-44% decreases, respectively. Transcriptional repression is specific to \nARR7\n and \nARR15\n, as transcript levels of two other A-type ARR genes, \nARR4\n and \nARR5\n, were elevated in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant seedlings compared with the wild type. Hypocotyls from \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants did not efficiently produce callus \nin vitro\n, indicating that an additional signal or signals are required to produce callus outside the SAM in these mutants (\nFig. S3A\n). Furthermore, multiple genes involved in wound-inducible and auxin-inducible callus production show altered expression in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants, including \nWIND1\n, \nWIND3\n, \nKPR2\n, \nKPR7\n, \nTSD1\n and \nTSD2\n (\nAnzola et al., 2010\n; \nFrank et al., 2002\n; \nIwase et al., 2011\n; \nKrupkova and Schmulling, 2009\n) (\nFig. S3B\n).\nPreventing Pro biosynthesis results in a dramatic increase in callus formation and CK levels in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background\n\n\nIt was not obvious how the constitutive plastid osmotic stress experienced by \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants might elicit these effects, but we reasoned that the hyper-accumulation of solutes previously observed in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants, especially the compatible osmolyte Proline (Pro) (\nWilson et al., 2014\n), might be responsible. To test this hypothesis, we crossed the \npyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase 1-1\n (\np5cs1-4\n) lesion into the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant background. P5CS1 catalyzes the primary step in the inducible production of Pro (\nVerslues and Sharma, 2010\n) and stress-induced Pro levels are low in this mutant (\nSzekely et al., 2008\n). \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutant seedlings exhibited larger calluses than the \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutant, frequently forming multiple calluses (\nFig. 1\nE and \nFig. S4A\n). Callus formation was also observed more frequently at earlier stages of development in \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple compared with \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutants (\nFig. 4\nA, light blue bars): at 14 DAG, over 40% of triple mutant seedlings had visible callus, while only 15% of the double \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants did (\nFig. 4\nA, light blue bars). Neither the wild type nor \np5cs1-4\n single mutants produced callus at any time point (\nFig. 1\nE, bottom two rows). A different mutant allele of \nP5CS1\n, \np5cs1-1\n (\nSzekely et al., 2008\n), also enhanced callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background (\nFig. S4B-C\n). In addition, \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutants contained seven times more trans-zeatin-riboside than \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants (\nFig. 3\nD). Supplementing growth medium with Pro had no effect on callus production in \nmsl2 msl3\n double or \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutants at any time point (\nFig. 4\nA), even though \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutant seedlings grown on 20 mM Pro for 21 DAG contained as much Pro as the \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutant (\nFig. 4\nB).\n\n\n\nFig. 4.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nPreventing Pro biosynthesis results in a dramatic increase in callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background.\n (A) Production of apical callus in \nmsl2 msl3\n and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n seedlings in the presence and absence of exogenous Pro.

Scale bars: 1 mm. Quantification of H\n2\nO\n2\n content by Amplex Red (D) and O\n2\n−\n production by NBT and formazan (E) in mutant and wild-type seedlings of indicated age. The average of three biological replicates (\nn\n≥20 seedlings each), two technical replicates each, is presented in both D and E. Statistical grouping in B,D,E was performed by ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test, \nP\n<0.01. Error bars indicate s.e.m. FW, fresh weight.\nThus, it is not the absence of Pro itself that leads to the enhanced callus production in the \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutants. Instead, disrupting the process of Pro biosynthesis could enhance callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant background if ROS accumulation were involved, as Pro biosynthesis is a reductive pathway that helps maintain cellular redox homeostasis (\nSzabados and Savoure, 2010\n). To characterize the levels and localization of ROS in \nmsl2 msl3\n double and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutants, 7-, 14- and 21-day-old mutant and wild-type seedlings were stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) to detect hydrogen peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n) or NitroBlue Tetrazolium (NBT) to detect superoxide (O\n2\n−\n) (\nFig. 4\nC). Both double and triple mutants accumulated high levels of H\n2\nO\n2\n and O\n2\n−\n in the SAM region relative to the \np5cs1-4\n single mutant or the wild type. Precipitate was visible earlier in the \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutant (by 14 DAG compared with 21 DAG in the double \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant). Quantification of H\n2\nO\n2\n levels using an Amplex Red enzyme assay at these same time points showed consistent accumulation of H\n2\nO\n2\n in the double and triple mutants, rising to nearly three times the wild-type level by 21 DAG (\nFig. 4\nD). Levels of formazan, the product of NBT reduction by O\n2\n−\n, increased in \nmsl2 msl3\n and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n to more than 2.5 times wild-type levels at 21 DAG (\nFig. 4\nE). Calluses generated by incubating \nArabidopsis thaliana\n Col-\n0\n root explants on callus inducing medium also showed strong NBT staining in areas of cell proliferation (\nFig. S3C\n), providing evidence that ROS accumulation may be a general feature of callus tissue (\nLee et al., 2004\n).\nThe accumulation of superoxide in response to plastid hypo-osmotic stress is required for callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background\n\n\nIn plastids, the photoreduction of molecular O\n2\n generates O\n2\n−\n, which is then rapidly converted into H\n2\nO\n2\n by plastid-localized superoxide dismutase enzymes (\nAsada, 2006\n). To determine if plastid osmotic stress and the accumulation of O\n2\n−\n at the apex of \nmsl2 msl3\n double and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutants play causative roles in callus formation, plants were germinated on or transferred to solid medium with 82 mM NaCl or with TEMPOL (a O\n2\n−\n scavenger) at 3 or 7 DAG and stained with NBT at 21 DAG. Growth on medium containing NaCl suppressed O\n2\n−\n accumulation in \nmsl2 msl3\n double and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutant seedlings (\nFig. 5\nA), completely prevented callus formation (\nFig. 5\nB) and suppressed defects in non-green plastid morphology (\nFig. 5\nC) and leaf morphology (\nFig. 5\nA). Thus, plastid osmotic stress is responsible for O\n2\n−\n accumulation as well as callus formation in \nmsl2 msl3\n and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n mutants. Consistent with \nFig. 1\nH, growth on NaCl suppressed callus formation and ROS accumulation only if supplied prior to 7 DAG.\n\n\n\nFig. 5.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nHyper-accumulation of superoxide is required for callus formation in \nmsl2 msl3\n and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1\n seedlings.\n (A) NBT-stained seedlings provided with TEMPOL or NaCl at 0, 3 or 7 DAG.

(E) Percentage of seedlings from D stained with NBT in three phenotypic categories (\nn\n≥20 seedlings). (F) Images of \nCSD2\n overexpression T2 lines. White arrows indicate deformed leaves. Scale bars: 5 mm.\nGrowth on TEMPOL-containing medium successfully prevented the accumulation of O\n2\n−\n in the SAM of \nmsl2 msl3\n and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n mutants, regardless of seedling age at time of application (\nFig. 5\nA), but did not affect plastid morphology (\nFig. 5\nC) or leaf morphology defects (\nFig. 5\nA). Treating double and triple mutant seedlings with TEMPOL at all developmental stages partially suppressed callus formation (\nFig. 5\nB). Less than 40% of double mutant seedlings exhibited apical calluses when grown in the presence of TEMPOL, compared with >90% when grown on MS without TEMPOL. TEMPOL-mediated callus suppression is thus independent or downstream of the developmental window in which addition of osmotic support must be provided for complete suppression of aerial phenotypes (\nFig. 1\nH and \nFig. 5\nA,B).\n\n\nA complementary genetic approach to suppressing O\n2\n−\n accumulation in the plastid was taken by overexpressing wild-type or miR398-resistant forms of the chloroplast-localized Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase CSD2 (\nKliebenstein et al., 1998\n; \nSunkar et al., 2006\n) in the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant background. The percentage of seedlings with visible apical callus at 21 DAG was decreased to 50% or less in six independent T2 lines expressing either wild-type (\nCSD2\n, lines 2, 4 and 7) or miR398-resistant (\nmCSD2\n, lines 1, 3, 5) \nCSD2\n (\nFig. 5\nD). Approximately 50% of T2 seedlings showed strong O\n2\n−\n accumulation by NBT staining, which was localized to developing callus, compared with 90% of \nmsl2 msl3\n seedlings (\nFig. 5\nE). In the \nCDS2\n overexpression lines, 15-30% of seedlings exhibited low levels of O\n2\n−\n accumulation at their shoot apex and did not develop callus; less than 5% of \nmsl2 msl3\n seedlings had these characteristics. Overexpression of \nCSD2\n did not suppress abnormal leaf development (white arrows, \nFig. 5\nF).\nCallus production requires ABA biosynthesis, ABI4 and GUN1\n\n\nAs \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutants exhibit increased levels of ABA and upregulation of ABA biosynthesis genes (\nWilson et al., 2014\n), we hypothesized that a pathway involving the hormone ABA and the \nGUN1\n and \nABI4\n gene products might account for the pleiotropic defects in the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant (\nKoussevitzky et al., 2007\n; \nZhang et al., 2013\n). To determine if ABA biosynthesis was required for callus production, we assessed the effect of introducing the \nabscisic acid-deficient 2-1\n allele (\nSchwartz et al., 1997\n) on callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background. Indeed, callus formation and leaf development defects were strongly suppressed in a triple \nmsl2 msl3 aba2-1\n mutant, with only ∼20% of seedlings developing callus at the shoot apex by 21 DAG (\nFig. 6\nA,B). Similar suppression of \nmsl2 msl3\n aerial defects was observed in four other independently isolated \nmsl2 msl3 aba2-1\n triple mutant lines. The \nmsl2 msl3 aba2-1\n triple mutant accumulated trans-zeatin-riboside to levels similar to those in the \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutant (\nFig. 3\nD), suggesting that ABA and CK promote callus formation through independent pathways.\n\n\n\nFig. 6.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nCallus production requires ABA biosynthesis, GUN1 and ABI4.\n (A) 21-day-old \nmsl2 msl3\n double and \nmsl2 msl3 aba2-1\n triple mutant seedlings.

(G) 21-day-old seedlings of the indicated genotypes stained with DAB or NBT. Scale bars: 1 mm (A,F,G) and 2.5 cm (C-E).\nTo test if GUN1 is involved in the perception of signals generated by plastid osmotic stress, we crossed the \ngun1-9\n (\nKoussevitzky et al., 2007\n) allele into the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant background and analyzed the offspring of a single \nmsl2 msl3 gun1-2\n (\n+/−\n) mutant plant. Of 27 triple \nmsl2 msl3 gun1-9\n seedlings identified by PCR genotyping, none formed apical callus when grown on solid medium, whereas 16 of 19 genotyped sibling \nmsl2 msl3 gun1-9\n (+/−) seedlings did\n.\n In addition, \nmsl2 msl3 gun1-9\n triple mutant siblings produced larger, greener and more normally shaped true leaves than their \nmsl2 msl3\n and \nmsl2 msl3 gun1-9+/1\n siblings (\nFig. 6\nC-E, \nFig. S5\n). In some seedlings, small and chlorotic true leaves developed at the seedling apex (\nFig. 6\nE, \nFig. S5\n).\n\n\nThe strong \nabi4-1\n allele (\nFinkelstein et al., 1998\n) was introduced into the \nmsl2 msl3\n background and \nmsl2 msl3 abi4-1\n mutants also exhibited reduced apical callus formation; only ∼26% of \nmsl2 msl3 abi4-1\n seedlings from two independently isolated lines developed callus (\nFig. 6\nB,F). Neither leaf developmental defects nor ROS accumulation was suppressed in the \nmsl2 msl3 abi4-1\n mutant and \nmsl2 msl3 abi4-1\n seedlings stained with DAB or NBT showed a pattern of ROS accumulation similar to the \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutant (\nFig. 6\nF,G). These staining patterns were not observed in the wild type or \nabi4-1\n single mutants. These results are consistent with a model wherein ABI4 functions downstream of ROS accumulation, probably in a pathway with GUN1, to induce apical callus formation in response to plastid osmotic stress.",

As previously documented (\nHaswell and Meyerowitz, 2006\n; \nJensen and Haswell, 2012\n; \nWilson et al., 2014\n), \nmsl2 msl3\n leaves were small and malformed. To facilitate comparison, the same leaf from each genotype is marked with an asterisk in the time course in \nFig. 1\nE. The percentage of \nmsl2 msl3\n seedlings with callus increased to ∼82% by 21 DAG (\nFig. 1\nF); callus was not observed in any wild-type plants at any developmental stage.\nWe previously showed that growth on medium containing increased levels of osmolytes (sugars or salt) suppressed the plastid morphology and leaf development phenotypes of \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants, probably by increasing cytoplasmic osmolarity and reducing plastid hypo-osmotic stress (\nVeley et al., 2012\n; \nWilson et al., 2014\n). To determine if the same was true for callus formation, and to assess the dependence of suppression on age and developmental stage, seedlings were germinated on MS solid medium and transferred to medium containing 82 mM NaCl at 2, 5, 7, or 9 DAG and assessed at 21 DAG for callus formation and leaf development. Full suppression of callus formation and abnormal leaf development was only observed in seedlings transferred to solid medium containing NaCl from MS at 2 DAG (\nFig. 1\nG-L), establishing a small developmental window after which alleviation of plastid hypo-osmotic stress can no longer suppress leaf morphology defects and apical callus production in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants. Suppression was also observed when seedlings were grown on medium containing sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol, indicating that the effect is osmotic (\nFig. S1A\n). The converse experiment, in which seedlings were transferred from salt-containing medium to normal MS showed that plastid osmotic homoeostasis is continuously required to maintain normal leaf development (\nFig. 1\nG,H and \nFig. S1B\n).",

Most cells within the cluster contained large, spherical, clear entities. In comparison, the SAM cells of a wild-type seedling were organized into cell layers and had small vacuoles. We next used transmission electron microscopy to further characterize the morphology of developing chloroplasts and proplastids in the SAM and surrounding tissue of \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant seedlings (\nFig. 2\nB). In the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant, young chloroplasts were enlarged, lacked the lens shape of wild-type chloroplasts and exhibited a disorganized developing thylakoid network (\nFig. 2\nB,D and \nFig. S2B\n). In agreement with previous reports (\nCharuvi et al., 2012\n), wild-type proplastids appeared as small structures (0.5-1 µm in diameter) containing rudimentary thylakoid networks of varying developmental stages, plastoglobules and double membranes (\nFig. 2\nE and \nFig. S2A\n).

Consistent with these observations, apical callus production, dwarfing and leaf phenotypes of the \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutant were strongly suppressed when seedlings were grown on medium with the synthetic auxin 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) (\nFig. 3\nA,C).

Two independently isolated \nmsl2 msl3 ahk2-2\n triple mutants showed a significant reduction in apical callus formation, with less than 40% of seedlings developing callus (\nFig. 3\nF). However, the \nmsl2 msl3 ahk2-2\n triple mutants were similar to the \nmsl2 msl3\n double with respect to the leaf developmental defect (\nFig. 3\nE). Incomplete suppression may be due to redundancy among CK receptors (\nGordon et al., 2009\n), or callus formation and leaf morphology defects may be produced through different pathways.\nTo determine if feedback loops involving \nWUS\n, ARR genes (\nGordon et al., 2009\n; \nSchuster et al., 2014\n), or the meristem identity gene \nSTM\n (\nScofield et al., 2013\n) were misregulated in \nmsl2 msl3\n seedlings, quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine transcript levels in the aerial tissue of 7- and 21-day-old seedlings (\nFig. 3\nG). In \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant seedlings \nWUS\n transcript levels were upregulated 5.3-fold compared with the wild type by 7 DAG (prior to visible callus development, \nFig. 1\nE); and 4-fold by 21 DAG. \nSTM\n expression levels were upregulated 2.1-fold in 7-day-old \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants, but were not distinguishable from the wild type at 21 DAG. Consistent with previous observations that they inhibit callus formation (\nBuechel et al., 2010\n; \nLiu et al., 2016\n), \nARR7\n and \nARR15\n transcript levels were reduced in both 7- and 21-day-old \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant seedlings compared with the wild type, exhibiting 43-55% and 13-44% decreases, respectively.

Hypocotyls from \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants did not efficiently produce callus \nin vitro\n, indicating that an additional signal or signals are required to produce callus outside the SAM in these mutants (\nFig. S3A\n).

    "preventing_pro_biosynthesis_results_in_a_dramatic_increase_i": "It was not obvious how the constitutive plastid osmotic stress experienced by \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants might elicit these effects, but we reasoned that the hyper-accumulation of solutes previously observed in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants, especially the compatible osmolyte Proline (Pro) (\nWilson et al., 2014\n), might be responsible.

Callus formation was also observed more frequently at earlier stages of development in \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple compared with \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutants (\nFig. 4\nA, light blue bars): at 14 DAG, over 40% of triple mutant seedlings had visible callus, while only 15% of the double \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants did (\nFig. 4\nA, light blue bars). Neither the wild type nor \np5cs1-4\n single mutants produced callus at any time point (\nFig. 1\nE, bottom two rows). A different mutant allele of \nP5CS1\n, \np5cs1-1\n (\nSzekely et al., 2008\n), also enhanced callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background (\nFig. S4B-C\n). In addition, \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutants contained seven times more trans-zeatin-riboside than \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants (\nFig. 3\nD). Supplementing growth medium with Pro had no effect on callus production in \nmsl2 msl3\n double or \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutants at any time point (\nFig. 4\nA), even though \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutant seedlings grown on 20 mM Pro for 21 DAG contained as much Pro as the \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutant (\nFig. 4\nB).\nFig. 4.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nPreventing Pro biosynthesis results in a dramatic increase in callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background.\n (A) Production of apical callus in \nmsl2 msl3\n and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n seedlings in the presence and absence of exogenous Pro.

Instead, disrupting the process of Pro biosynthesis could enhance callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant background if ROS accumulation were involved, as Pro biosynthesis is a reductive pathway that helps maintain cellular redox homeostasis (\nSzabados and Savoure, 2010\n). To characterize the levels and localization of ROS in \nmsl2 msl3\n double and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutants, 7-, 14- and 21-day-old mutant and wild-type seedlings were stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) to detect hydrogen peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n) or NitroBlue Tetrazolium (NBT) to detect superoxide (O\n2\n−\n) (\nFig. 4\nC). Both double and triple mutants accumulated high levels of H\n2\nO\n2\n and O\n2\n−\n in the SAM region relative to the \np5cs1-4\n single mutant or the wild type. Precipitate was visible earlier in the \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutant (by 14 DAG compared with 21 DAG in the double \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant). Quantification of H\n2\nO\n2\n levels using an Amplex Red enzyme assay at these same time points showed consistent accumulation of H\n2\nO\n2\n in the double and triple mutants, rising to nearly three times the wild-type level by 21 DAG (\nFig. 4\nD). Levels of formazan, the product of NBT reduction by O\n2\n−\n, increased in \nmsl2 msl3\n and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n to more than 2.5 times wild-type levels at 21 DAG (\nFig. 4\nE).

To determine if plastid osmotic stress and the accumulation of O\n2\n−\n at the apex of \nmsl2 msl3\n double and \nmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4\n triple mutants play causative roles in callus formation, plants were germinated on or transferred to solid medium with 82 mM NaCl or with TEMPOL (a O\n2\n−\n scavenger) at 3 or 7 DAG and stained with NBT at 21 DAG.

Treating double and triple mutant seedlings with TEMPOL at all developmental stages partially suppressed callus formation (\nFig. 5\nB). Less than 40% of double mutant seedlings exhibited apical calluses when grown in the presence of TEMPOL, compared with >90% when grown on MS without TEMPOL. TEMPOL-mediated callus suppression is thus independent or downstream of the developmental window in which addition of osmotic support must be provided for complete suppression of aerial phenotypes (\nFig. 1\nH and \nFig. 5\nA,B).\nA complementary genetic approach to suppressing O\n2\n−\n accumulation in the plastid was taken by overexpressing wild-type or miR398-resistant forms of the chloroplast-localized Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase CSD2 (\nKliebenstein et al., 1998\n; \nSunkar et al., 2006\n) in the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant background.

To determine if ABA biosynthesis was required for callus production, we assessed the effect of introducing the \nabscisic acid-deficient 2-1\n allele (\nSchwartz et al., 1997\n) on callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background. Indeed, callus formation and leaf development defects were strongly suppressed in a triple \nmsl2 msl3 aba2-1\n mutant, with only ∼20% of seedlings developing callus at the shoot apex by 21 DAG (\nFig. 6\nA,B). Similar suppression of \nmsl2 msl3\n aerial defects was observed in four other independently isolated \nmsl2 msl3 aba2-1\n triple mutant lines. The \nmsl2 msl3 aba2-1\n triple mutant accumulated trans-zeatin-riboside to levels similar to those in the \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutant (\nFig. 3\nD), suggesting that ABA and CK promote callus formation through independent pathways.\nFig. 6.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nCallus production requires ABA biosynthesis, GUN1 and ABI4.\n (A) 21-day-old \nmsl2 msl3\n double and \nmsl2 msl3 aba2-1\n triple mutant seedlings.

Of 27 triple \nmsl2 msl3 gun1-9\n seedlings identified by PCR genotyping, none formed apical callus when grown on solid medium, whereas 16 of 19 genotyped sibling \nmsl2 msl3 gun1-9\n (+/−) seedlings did\n.\n In addition, \nmsl2 msl3 gun1-9\n triple mutant siblings produced larger, greener and more normally shaped true leaves than their \nmsl2 msl3\n and \nmsl2 msl3 gun1-9+/1\n siblings (\nFig. 6\nC-E, \nFig. S5\n).

    "discussion": "One of the most fundamental decisions a cell can make is whether to proliferate or to differentiate. In the plant SAM, this decision must be spatially and temporally controlled, so that cells remain in an undifferentiated, pluripotent state in the central zone of the meristem and then differentiate properly as they are recruited into organs at the PZ. Here, we use the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant as a model system to show that, in the \nArabidopsis\n SAM, proliferation versus differentiation signals are coordinated not only at the tissue and cellular level, but also at the organellar level. We further applied genetic, molecular, biochemical and pharmacological approaches to identify two non-redundant pathways through which plastid osmotic stress may produce apical callus (illustrated in \nFig. S6\n).\nPlastid osmotic stress results in the production of callus at the plant SAM\n\n\nPlants lacking functional versions of the mechanosensitive ion channel homologs MSL2 and MSL3 robustly produce callus tissue at the apex of the plant when grown on solid medium (\nFig. 1\n). Molecular complementation with \nMSL2\n under the control of the \nSCARECROW\n promoter established that MSL2/MSL3 are required only in the L1 layer of the CZ and/or PZ of the SAM to prevent callus formation (\nFig. 1\nM) and that their function is crucial during the first 5 days after germination (\nFig. 1\nG-L). The production of apical callus in the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant is associated with dramatically enlarged and developmentally abnormal plastids, specifically in the SAM (\nFig. 2\n, \nFig. S2\n). Developmentally defective plastids were also observed in the SAM of another apical callus-producing mutant, \ntumorous shoot development 1\n (\ntsd1\n) (\nFrank et al., 2002\n).\nIncreased proliferation and the production of callus in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants is associated with a disruption in the CK/WUS feedback loop\n\n\nThe \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants exhibit several previously established hallmarks of increased proliferation at the SAM, including increased levels of CK, upregulation of the stem cell identity gene \nWUSCHEL\n and downregulation of CK signaling inhibitors (\nFig. 3\nD,G), suggesting that plastid osmotic stress activates the CK/WUS feedback loop (\nGaillochet et al., 2015\n; \nIkeuchi et al., 2013\n) (top pathway, \nFig. S6\n). The resulting imbalance in the cytokinin: auxin ratio may underlie callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background, as supplementing seedlings with exogenous auxin robustly suppresses all mutant phenotypes (\nFig. 3\nA,C) without affecting plastid osmotic stress (\nFig. 3\nB). In addition, the CK receptor AHK2 is required for efficient callus formation (\nFig. 3\nE,F). \nAHK2\n is required to maintain WUS expression in the meristem in response to CK treatment in the CK/WUS feedback loop (\nGordon et al., 2009\n). As cytokinin and auxin are involved in the production of all types of callus (\nPerianez-Rodriguez et al., 2014\n; \nSkoog and Miller, 1957\n), alternative pathways to callus production cannot be ruled out.\n\n\nSeveral previously identified callus-producing mutants in \nArabidopsis\n and \nHelianthus\n also exhibit upregulated CK signaling and defects in meristem identity gene expression, including \ntsd1\n (\nFrank et al., 2002\n; \nKrupkova and Schmulling, 2009\n), EMB-2 (\nChiappetta et al., 2006\n) and the \npasticcino\n mutants (\nFaure et al., 1998\n; \nHarrar et al., 2003\n). These data suggest that the CK-induced pathway, the wound-induced pathway and the meristematic identity pathway are interconnected for callus production. Furthermore, the \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutant is the only callus-producing mutant identified to date with a primary defect in plastid-localized proteins, adding a novel regulatory aspect to these known pathways, and suggesting that plastid osmotic stress is uniquely able to trigger these pathways. While we favor the model shown in \nFig. S6\n, other interpretations are possible. Also consistent with these data is a model wherein the \nmsl2 msl3\n lesions lead to downregulation of \nTSD1\n and/or \nTSD2\n, or upregulation of WIND genes, either of which could disrupt the CK/WUS loop.\nPlastid retrograde signaling is required for increased proliferation and the production of callus\n\n\nGenetic lesions that reduce Pro biosynthesis significantly exacerbated callus production in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background – an effect that cannot be attributed to low levels of Pro itself (\nFig. 1\nE, \nFig. 4\n, \nFig. S4\n). Instead, the hyper-accumulation of ROS that results from blocking Pro biosynthesis is required (\nFig. 5\n). Treatment with exogenous ROS scavenger TEMPOL as well as overproduction of CSD2, a chloroplast-localized superoxide-scavenging enzyme, prevented or reduced callus formation. Plastid osmotic stress was required for hyper-accumulation of ROS (\nFig. 5\nA-C). In addition, our analysis of callus formation in higher-order mutants established that ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and the transcription factor ABI4 were required for callus formation and act downstream of ROS (\nFig. 6\n; bottom pathway in \nFig. S6\n). Because we were able to specifically suppress callus production, ROS accumulation and impaired leaf development by increasing cytoplasmic osmolarity in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background, this phenotype is very unlikely to be due to a loss of specific signaling by MSL2 or MSL3.\n\n\nMultiple genetic links between plastid function and cell differentiation in the shoot have been previously described and are often cited as evidence for retrograde signaling (\nInaba and Ito-Inaba, 2010\n; \nLepisto and Rintamaki, 2012\n; \nLundquist et al., 2014\n). ROS accumulation has been documented in at least one other callus-producing mutant, \ntsd2\n/\nquasimodo2\n (\nRaggi et al., 2015\n). Whether ROS and/or an ABA/GUN1/ABI4 retrograde signaling pathway are employed to communicate plastid dysfunction to shoot development in any of these other mutants is not known. However, the application of pharmacological inhibitors of plastid development or function was used to demonstrate that leaf adaxial/abaxial patterning is regulated by plastid protein translation in a GUN1-dependent pathway (\nTameshige et al., 2013\n), a pathway that is required to facilitate the switch from leaf cell proliferation to expansion and differentiation (\nAndriankaja et al., 2012\n). Taken together with the results reported here, these data support previously proposed models wherein a variety of plastid dysfunctions are communicated to leaf development through similar or overlapping pathways that include GUN1 (\nKoussevitzky et al., 2007\n; \nLeon et al., 2012\n). ABI4 may function with GUN1 in this retrograde signaling pathway, or the reduction in \nmsl2 msl3\n callus production in the \nabi4-1\n mutant background may result from indirect effects on sugar signaling or ABA biosynthesis.\n\n\nWe note that only a few of the genetic or pharmacological treatments that suppressed callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant also suppressed the leaf developmental defects. Growth on exogenous auxin was the only treatment to completely suppress all of the mutant phenotypes, whereas preventing CK signaling, ABA biosynthesis, ROS accumulation or GUN1 or ABI4 function only partially rescued leaf defects (\nFig. 3\nE, \nFig. 5\nF, \nFig. 6\n). It is possible that these differences are due to genetic redundancy or to limited uptake or transport of TEMPOL. Alternatively, there may be two fundamentally different processes that respond to plastid osmotic stress in the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant: one that functions in the SAM during early development and one that functions later on in the leaves. In support of the latter proposal, subjecting seedlings to mild hyperosmotic stress has been shown to prevent leaf cell proliferation (\nSkirycz et al., 2011\n).\nmsl2 msl3\n mutants may provide a functional link between the CK/WUS feedback loop and plastid retrograde signaling to control cell differentiation at the plant apex\n\n\nOur working model, illustrated in \nFig. S6\n, is that the production of apical callus in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants operates through two non-redundant pathways: the CK/WUS feedback loop and a retrograde signaling pathway involving ROS, ABA, ABI4 and GUN1. While the data presented here establish that both of these pathways are required for callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background, whether they operate completely independently or are interconnected is not yet clear. Here, we present them as separate pathways; support for this comes from the fact that CK levels remain elevated in the \naba2 msl2 msl3\n triple mutant (\nFig. 3\nD), indicating that ABA biosynthesis is not upstream of the CK/WUS feedback loop. Furthermore, mutants that solely overproduce plastid ROS (\nMyouga et al., 2008\n) upregulate CK signaling (\nTo et al., 2004\n), or hyper-accumulate Pro (\nMattioli et al., 2008\n) have not been reported to produce apical callus, implying that a combination of these signals is required.\n\n\nWe speculate that two-way communication between plastids and cell differentiation is essential to coordinate the developmental and functional state of the plastid with that of the cell within which it resides, and that it therefore necessarily involves multiple pathways. These results add yet another layer of complexity to the many regulatory pathways and feedback loops that govern dynamic cell identity decision-making at the plant shoot apex and provide a foundation for future investigation into the relationship between meristem identity and plastid osmotic homeostasis in the SAM.",

As cytokinin and auxin are involved in the production of all types of callus (\nPerianez-Rodriguez et al., 2014\n; \nSkoog and Miller, 1957\n), alternative pathways to callus production cannot be ruled out.\nSeveral previously identified callus-producing mutants in \nArabidopsis\n and \nHelianthus\n also exhibit upregulated CK signaling and defects in meristem identity gene expression, including \ntsd1\n (\nFrank et al., 2002\n; \nKrupkova and Schmulling, 2009\n), EMB-2 (\nChiappetta et al., 2006\n) and the \npasticcino\n mutants (\nFaure et al., 1998\n; \nHarrar et al., 2003\n). These data suggest that the CK-induced pathway, the wound-induced pathway and the meristematic identity pathway are interconnected for callus production. Furthermore, the \nmsl2 msl3\n double mutant is the only callus-producing mutant identified to date with a primary defect in plastid-localized proteins, adding a novel regulatory aspect to these known pathways, and suggesting that plastid osmotic stress is uniquely able to trigger these pathways. While we favor the model shown in \nFig. S6\n, other interpretations are possible. Also consistent with these data is a model wherein the \nmsl2 msl3\n lesions lead to downregulation of \nTSD1\n and/or \nTSD2\n, or upregulation of WIND genes, either of which could disrupt the CK/WUS loop.",
    "plastid_retrograde_signaling_is_required_for_increased_proli": "Genetic lesions that reduce Pro biosynthesis significantly exacerbated callus production in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background – an effect that cannot be attributed to low levels of Pro itself (\nFig. 1\nE, \nFig. 4\n, \nFig. S4\n). Instead, the hyper-accumulation of ROS that results from blocking Pro biosynthesis is required (\nFig. 5\n). Treatment with exogenous ROS scavenger TEMPOL as well as overproduction of CSD2, a chloroplast-localized superoxide-scavenging enzyme, prevented or reduced callus formation. Plastid osmotic stress was required for hyper-accumulation of ROS (\nFig. 5\nA-C). In addition, our analysis of callus formation in higher-order mutants established that ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and the transcription factor ABI4 were required for callus formation and act downstream of ROS (\nFig. 6\n; bottom pathway in \nFig. S6\n). Because we were able to specifically suppress callus production, ROS accumulation and impaired leaf development by increasing cytoplasmic osmolarity in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background, this phenotype is very unlikely to be due to a loss of specific signaling by MSL2 or MSL3.\nMultiple genetic links between plastid function and cell differentiation in the shoot have been previously described and are often cited as evidence for retrograde signaling (\nInaba and Ito-Inaba, 2010\n; \nLepisto and Rintamaki, 2012\n; \nLundquist et al., 2014\n). ROS accumulation has been documented in at least one other callus-producing mutant, \ntsd2\n/\nquasimodo2\n (\nRaggi et al., 2015\n). Whether ROS and/or an ABA/GUN1/ABI4 retrograde signaling pathway are employed to communicate plastid dysfunction to shoot development in any of these other mutants is not known. However, the application of pharmacological inhibitors of plastid development or function was used to demonstrate that leaf adaxial/abaxial patterning is regulated by plastid protein translation in a GUN1-dependent pathway (\nTameshige et al., 2013\n), a pathway that is required to facilitate the switch from leaf cell proliferation to expansion and differentiation (\nAndriankaja et al., 2012\n). Taken together with the results reported here, these data support previously proposed models wherein a variety of plastid dysfunctions are communicated to leaf development through similar or overlapping pathways that include GUN1 (\nKoussevitzky et al., 2007\n; \nLeon et al., 2012\n). ABI4 may function with GUN1 in this retrograde signaling pathway, or the reduction in \nmsl2 msl3\n callus production in the \nabi4-1\n mutant background may result from indirect effects on sugar signaling or ABA biosynthesis.\nWe note that only a few of the genetic or pharmacological treatments that suppressed callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant also suppressed the leaf developmental defects. Growth on exogenous auxin was the only treatment to completely suppress all of the mutant phenotypes, whereas preventing CK signaling, ABA biosynthesis, ROS accumulation or GUN1 or ABI4 function only partially rescued leaf defects (\nFig. 3\nE, \nFig. 5\nF, \nFig. 6\n). It is possible that these differences are due to genetic redundancy or to limited uptake or transport of TEMPOL. Alternatively, there may be two fundamentally different processes that respond to plastid osmotic stress in the \nmsl2 msl3\n mutant: one that functions in the SAM during early development and one that functions later on in the leaves. In support of the latter proposal, subjecting seedlings to mild hyperosmotic stress has been shown to prevent leaf cell proliferation (\nSkirycz et al., 2011\n).",
    "msl2_msl3_mutants_may_provide_a_functional_link_between_the_": "Our working model, illustrated in \nFig. S6\n, is that the production of apical callus in \nmsl2 msl3\n mutants operates through two non-redundant pathways: the CK/WUS feedback loop and a retrograde signaling pathway involving ROS, ABA, ABI4 and GUN1. While the data presented here establish that both of these pathways are required for callus formation in the \nmsl2 msl3\n background, whether they operate completely independently or are interconnected is not yet clear. Here, we present them as separate pathways; support for this comes from the fact that CK levels remain elevated in the \naba2 msl2 msl3\n triple mutant (\nFig. 3\nD), indicating that ABA biosynthesis is not upstream of the CK/WUS feedback loop. Furthermore, mutants that solely overproduce plastid ROS (\nMyouga et al., 2008\n) upregulate CK signaling (\nTo et al., 2004\n), or hyper-accumulate Pro (\nMattioli et al., 2008\n) have not been reported to produce apical callus, implying that a combination of these signals is required.\nWe speculate that two-way communication between plastids and cell differentiation is essential to coordinate the developmental and functional state of the plastid with that of the cell within which it resides, and that it therefore necessarily involves multiple pathways. These results add yet another layer of complexity to the many regulatory pathways and feedback loops that govern dynamic cell identity decision-making at the plant shoot apex and provide a foundation for future investigation into the relationship between meristem identity and plastid osmotic homeostasis in the SAM.",
