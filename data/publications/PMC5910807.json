    "significance": "Investigations of the free-living nematode \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n give powerful insights into fundamental biological processes that are conserved across species. Locomotion of this model organism is used to assess muscular and neural defects and score impacts of genetic mutations and pharmacological interventions. Existing analyses of the nematode gait have been focused on 2D locomotion, and 3D motion remains largely unexplored. We identify and mathematically describe a unique 3D behavioral pattern in burrowing and swimming—a roll maneuver—which, in combination with 2D turns, allows the nematode to explore bulk media. Our results provide important insights into 3D neuromuscular actuation and may be used to develop better assays for locomotion phenotype analysis.\nKeywords:\n \nCaenorhabdtis elegans\n, undulatory locomotion, 3D gait, maneuverability, behavior",
    "abstract": "Locomotion of the nematode \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n is a key observable used in investigations ranging from behavior to neuroscience to aging. However, while the natural environment of this model organism is 3D, quantitative investigations of its locomotion have been mostly limited to 2D motion. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of how the nematode reorients itself in 3D media. We identify a unique behavioral state of \nC. elegans\n—a roll maneuver—which is an essential component of 3D locomotion in burrowing and swimming. The rolls, associated with nonzero torsion of the nematode body, result in rotation of the plane of dorsoventral body undulations about the symmetry axis of the trajectory. When combined with planar turns in a new undulation plane, the rolls allow the nematode to reorient its body in any direction, thus enabling complete exploration of 3D space. The rolls observed in swimming are much faster than the ones in burrowing; we show that this difference stems from a purely hydrodynamic enhancement mechanism and not from a gait change or an increase in the body torsion. This result demonstrates that hydrodynamic viscous forces can enhance 3D reorientation in undulatory locomotion, in contrast to known hydrodynamic hindrance of both forward motion and planar turns.",
    "active_spatial_reorientation_maneuvers_of_c._elegans:_planar": "In our investigation of 3D locomotion of \nC. elegans\n in bulk media we focus on active body reorientation, in contrast to recently studied passive changes of locomotion direction produced by interactions of the nematode body with obstacles (\n37\n), boundaries (\n30\n), and/or external flow (\n31\n). Active reorientation maneuvers (\n29\n) have received, so far, much less attention, despite their importance for search behavior, chemotaxis, thermotaxis, and escape response.\nAs illustrated in \nFig. 1\n for a swimming nematode (also corresponding \nMovies S1\n and \nS2\n), \nC. elegans\n can reorient its body by combining 2D turns in the plane of dorsoventral undulations with 3D roll maneuvers that result in axial rotation of the undulation plane. Turns in 2D are executed by asymmetrically altering the amplitude of planar body undulations (\n28\n, \n29\n, \n34\n, \n38\n), whereas rolls require nonplanar body postures. Our geometricalanalysis (presented in \nTorsional Roll Is a Unique 3D Behavioral State\n) of available stereoscopic nematode images (\n33\n) demonstrates that turns and rolls can also be observed for nematodes burrowing in soft gel-like media.\nFig. 1.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nTypical reorientation maneuvers of swimming \nC. elegans\n. Shown are time-lapse images of a swimming \nC. elegans\n (\nA\n) performing a 2D turn and (\nB\n) rapidly switching the plane of undulations in a 3D roll maneuver. The nematode moves from right to left in both \nA\n and \nB\n. The arrows in \nB\n indicate the location of the ovary, helping to identify the nematode body orientation. (Magnification: 1.6×.)\nA combination of planar turns and 3D rolls allows \nC. elegans\n to reorient itself in any direction (schematically depicted in \nFig. 2\n), whereas 2D turning maneuvers alone [e.g., \nΩ\n turns (\n6\n), loop/\nδ\n turns (\n28\n, \n33\n, \n39\n), and pirouettes (\n40\n)] restrict nematode movements to one plane. Thus, the roll maneuvers identified in this work constitute an important behavioral state; this crucial locomotion component enables \nC. elegans\n to explore 3D media in search for optimal environmental conditions.\nFig. 2.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nSchematic illustrating nematode reorientation in 3D. The worm (\nA\n) undulates in the initial plane of motion, (\nB\n) executes a roll maneuver, and (\nC\n) performs a planar turn in the new plane of motion.\nMovie S1\n and video images shown in \nFig. 1\nA\n [and our prior study (\n29\n)] reveal that planar turns in swimming are shallower than no-slip turns in crawling or burrowing (analogous to the reduced forward progression in swimming). In contrast, swimming rolls (\nMovie S2\n and \nFig. 1\nB\n) can be significantly more rapid than those found for burrowing. The effectiveness of turn and roll maneuvers in burrowing and swimming is assessed by solving equations of motion for the nematode body moving in gels and fluids. Our calculations show that the same hydrodynamic resistance forces that reduce the swimming velocity (\n29\n, \n41\n, \n42\n) and planar turn angles (\n29\n) significantly enhance the roll rotation rate. This counterintuitive result of our theoretical analysis agrees well with experimental observations.\nThe geometry of 3D nematode motion is significantly more involved than planar geometry. Therefore, to faithfully identify and interpret specific locomotory behavioral patterns of \nC. elegans\n and understand hydrodynamic mechanisms of enhancement of the roll maneuvers, we need adequate tools for describing body postures. To explain the geometry of nematode movements in 3D, we thus generalize the recently proposed piecewise harmonic curvature (PHC) model of planar nematode gait (\n28\n, \n29\n) by introducing the curve torsion to the gait description.",

    "maneuverability_of_swimming_c._elegans_in_bulk_fluids": "In environments with different mechanical properties typical body postures of \nC. elegans\n are distinct because the undulation wavelength \nλ\n differs relative to the body length \nL\n (\nFig. 4\n); however, the harmonic-curvature undulation waveform described by \nEqs. \n1\n–\n3\n is preserved (\n28\n). In particular, the geometrical similarity between the swimming and crawling gaits is corroborated by the important observation by Fang-Yen et al. (\n25\n) that the wavelength of undulations in swimming continuously decreases with increasing fluid viscosity, and in highly viscous fluids the swimming gait is very similar to the crawling gait. Thus, fluid viscosity affects the undulation wavelength, but the waveform is unaffected.\nSwimming Trajectories Depend on the Gait Geometry and Hydrodynamic Force and Torque Balance.\n\n\nBased on the above observations, we conclude that the gait description developed in the previous sections to elucidate no-slip locomotion yields a suitable framework for inquiry into the mechanics of reorientation maneuvers of swimming \nC. elegans\n. Accordingly, we assume that the waveform \nEq. \n2\n of the propagating curvature and torsion is maintained in fluids, and we decompose the motion of a swimming nematode into the geometrical component \ni\n and dynamical component \nii\n, where \ni\n is the progression along the curvilinear path determined by the curvature and torsion functions \nκ\n(\ns\n)\n and \nτ\n(\ns\n)\n, and \nii\n is the rigid-body translation and rotation resulting from the hydrodynamic force and torque balance on the entire nematode body.\n\n\nDue to the presence of the translational and rotational motion \nii\n, the trajectories of swimming nematodes differ from those of crawling/burrowing nematodes using the same sequence of body postures and moving along a no-slip path. Moreover, in swimming the trajectories depend not only on the form of the curvature and torsion waves, but also on the normalized undulation wavelength \nλ\n/\nL\n, whereas the no-slip path \ni\n is independent of this parameter.\n\n\nThe above decomposition into \ni\n and \nii\n is particularly useful in the linear creeping-flow regime (considered here), because in this case there are no inertial effects, and the total hydrodynamic force and torque can be evaluated by superposing the forces and torques associated with the component velocities \ni\n and \nii\n.

The swimming nematodes undergo the same sequence of body postures as the crawling/burrowing ones, but their corresponding trajectories differ because of the translational and rotational velocity component \nii\n that is present only in swimming. \nFig. 7\nD\n shows the dependence of the turn angle on the turning-mode amplitude \nA\n2\n/\nq\n for both cases. Consistent with the experimental results (\nFig. 1\nA\n and \nMovie S1\n), the turn angles in swimming are relatively shallow, as a result of the hydrodynamically induced rotation.\n\n\nThe swimming angles are always significantly smaller than the corresponding angles for crawling (or burrowing); this hydrodynamic hindrance is especially pronounced for small turning-mode amplitudes. A swimming nematode usually needs to perform several turns to significantly change its locomotion direction. A typical case of such a combined multimode turning maneuver is presented in \nMovie S1\n, which shows a turn of a swimming wild-type \nC. elegans\n along with a matching hydrodynamic simulation.\nRoll Rotation Rate in Swimming Is Increased Compared with No-Slip Motion.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFig. 1\nB\n and the corresponding \nMovie S2\n, a swimming nematode can quickly change the plane of undulations by performing a roll maneuver. Our experimental observations indicate that a roll by 90° often occurs in one undulation period, and faster rolls are not unusual. This rotation is much more rapid than the rotation observed in burrowing (\nFig. 6\n).\n\n\nOur images of swimming \nC. elegans\n undergoing undulation-plane reorientation indicate that the nematode body postures are nonplanar, similar to the corresponding behavior in burrowing. These 3D swimming postures closely resemble the torsional-roll configurations defined by \nEqs. \n3\n and \n4\n, as depicted in \nFig. 8 \nA\n and \nB\n. While the out-of-plane deformation of the nematode body shown in \nFig. 8\nA\n seems quite small, our hydrodynamic simulations indicate that even such a relatively minor out-of-plane torsional distortion can result in a rapid reorientation of the undulation plane.\n\n\nFig. 8.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nThree-mode torsional roll of a swimming \nC. elegans\n.

At times \nt\n1\n and \nt\n4\n the nematode performs planar undulations; at \nt\n2\n and \nt\n3\n it performs a roll with gait parameters corresponding to the posture shown in \nB\n; the total length of the torsional roll mode is \nq\nΔ\ns\nτ\n=\n2\nπ\n. The roll results in a change of the undulation plane by \n∼\n90\n∘\n.\nSuch rapid axial reorientation is illustrated by the hydrodynamic simulations of three-mode roll maneuvers presented in \nFig. 8\nC\n and in \nMovie S3\n. In both cases the nematode undergoes a roll rotation of \n∼\n90\n∘\n in less than one period of undulations, in agreement with our experimental observations.\n\n\nThe effectiveness of roll reorientation in fluids is quantitatively assessed in \nFig. 9\nA\n for \nC\n-shaped gait and in \nFig. 9\nB\n for \nW\n-shaped gait in terms of the roll rotation rate \nω\nroll\n per undulation period. Since the hydrodynamic component of the rolling rate is affected by the nematode length \nL\n, the results are shown versus \nτ\n0\nL\n, that is, the torsion normalized by \nL\n. Similar to the corresponding result for the no-slip roll of a burrowing nematode (\nFig. 5\nB\n), the roll rotation rate in swimming decreases with the normalized curvature-wave amplitude \nA\n/\nq\n. However, the relation between \nω\nroll\n and the torsion is nonlinear, and the dependence on the normalized undulation amplitude \nA\n/\nq\n is significantly weaker, due to hydrodynamic effects. The roll rotation for \nC\n-shaped and \nW\n-shaped gaits has a similar magnitude for given values of \nA\n/\nq\n and \nτ\n0\nL\n.\n\n\nFig. 9.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nHydrodynamic enhancement of roll rotation rate.

Results are presented for \nC\n-shaped and \nW\n-shaped gaits (as labeled) and normalized harmonic-curvature amplitude \nA\n/\nq\n=\n1\n.\nA Comparison of Roll Rotation Rate in Burrowing and Swimming Provides Evidence for a Significant Hydrodynamic Enhancement.\n\n\nTo directly compare the swimming roll rotation rate \nω\nroll\n shown in \nFig. 9 \nA\n and \nB\n with the corresponding purely geometrical no-slip result (\nFig. 5\nB\n), the swimming and no-slip simulation data are replotted in \nFig. 9\nC\n using the same scaling of the torsion \nτ\n0\n/\nq\n for both datasets. The results indicate that hydrodynamic forces in swimming can enhance the rotation rate in a very significant way. Compared with the values in the no-slip burrowing case (for the same sequence of nematode body motions), the roll rotation rate \nω\nroll\n in swimming increases by a factor ranging from approximately 2 (for \nC\n-shaped gait) to even 3 (for \nW\n-shaped gait). For example, a swimming nematode using a \nW\n-shaped gait [e.g., \nC. elegans\n swimming in a highly viscous dextran solution (\n25\n)] would rotate at a rate \nω\nroll\n≈\n120\n∘\n per undulation period for body torsion \nτ\n0\n/\nq\n=\n0.15\n.

    "the_mechanisms_of_hydrodynamic_hindrance_and_enhancement": "As illustrated in \nFigs. 10\n and \n11\n, both the hindrance of planar locomotion and the 3D roll enhancement result from the longitudinal resistance forces (acting parallel to local body segments).

In burrowing, the longitudinal resistance is too weak (compared with the transverse resistance) to produce any significant body displacements; thus the nematode moves along the purely geometrical no-slip path \ni\n, defined by the curvature and torsion wave. In swimming, the force and torque associated with the longitudinal resistance produce additional translation and rotation of the nematode body \nii\n (indicated by blue arrows in \nFigs. 10\n and \n11\n).\nFig. 10.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nMechanism of hydrodynamic hindrance of planar motion. \nA\n and \nB\n show no-slip paths (thin dashed line) and nematode positions (thick lines) in no-slip crawling/burrowing and swimming.

    "discussion": "Torsional Roll Is a Unique Behavioral State That Is Essential for 3D Locomotion.\n\n\nBased on our investigation of available stereoscopic images and other experimental evidence, we have shown that \nC. elegans\n explore their 3D environment by combining planar turns with roll reorientation maneuvers. The rolls, during which the undulation plane of the worm rotates about the trajectory axis, constitute an important previously unrecognized behavioral pattern that is an essential component of 3D locomotion.\n\n\nTo identify the roll maneuvers and describe their geometry, we have developed a mathematical representation of the 3D nematode gait. According to our analysis, the roll maneuvers combine harmonic curvature with a piecewise constant torsion that causes the undulation-plane reorientation. Our 3D model of roll maneuvers faithfully reproduces all key geometrical features of the observed roll behavior of a burrowing nematode and, when integrated with appropriate hydrodynamic calculations, replicates a rapid roll rotation observed in swimming. We have provided a physical explanation of this unexpected hydrodynamic enhancement effect in the 3D roll maneuver.\n\n\nOur modeling approach provides a powerful tool for investigating 3D locomotion of \nC. elegans\n, including initiation and execution of behavioral patterns associated with 3D reorientation. For example, our techniques can be applied to analyze chemotaxis strategies and escape responses, as well as to evaluate the effect of nematode health and age on locomotory abilities. In \nApplication to Chemotaxis\n we describe a proof-of-concept calculation showing that the nematode can use a combination of turn and roll reorientation maneuvers to efficiently chemotax in 3D environments. To illustrate typical maneuvers in 3D space, we present two examples of numerical simulations of a nematode performing multiple turns and rolls (\nMovie S4\n for burrowing and \nMovie S5\n for swimming).\n\n\nOur analysis reveals that both the burrowing and swimming rolls involve a similar pattern of nematode movements defined by a curvature wave with nonzero torsion. Several recent experimental studies showed that the nematode gait is not significantly affected by the rheological properties of the suspending medium (\n48\n–\n51\n), for the system parameters investigated. Such results were documented for viscoelastic fluids (\n48\n), shear-thinning fluids (\n50\n), and entangled polymeric solutions (\n49\n). For nematodes swimming in a shear-thinning suspension (\n51\n), a moderate increase in the head-bending angle was observed, but even in this case, the overall form of undulations remained similar to the waveform observed in Newtonian fluids. Based on the above wide spectrum of systems in which rheological properties of the suspending medium do not affect the locomotory undulation pattern, we conclude that the same simple undulation waveform likely occurs for \nC. elegans\n moving in a variety of complex media present in its natural environment. Moreover, since roll maneuvers provide effective 3D reorientation and do not require complicated patterns of body actuation, we anticipate that similar rolls are performed by other undulatory burrowers and swimmers.\nTorsional Roll Maneuvers Help Sedimented Adult Nematodes Maintain Swimming Capabilities.\n\n\nTrajectories of swimming \nC. elegans\n are affected not only by active actuation but also by buoyancy forces. During the larval stages of development and for nematodes swimming in highly viscous aqueous solutions of organic matter (common in \nC. elegans\n habitat) the effect of buoyancy is negligible. Adult nematodes swimming in water, however, tend to settle down toward the bottom of the pool and reside close to the bottom surface, following its topology (\n52\n). As shown by Yuan et al. (\n52\n), the worms remain suspended due to the upward force that results from continuous head collisions with the bottom wall when the nematode body undulates in an approximately vertical plane.\n\n\nIn our experiments, we find that during this near-the-bottom locomotion, nematodes perform frequent rolls (one roll of about 90° per several undulation periods), with the frequency similar to the roll frequency in a bulk fluid. The rolls allow the worms to repeatedly attain approximately vertical orientation of the undulation plane (\nMovie S6\n). Such a vertical orientation is necessary for the sedimenting worms to be able to generate the upward resuspending force through collisions with the bottom. We thus conclude that the roll maneuvers are used by \nC. elegans\n not only to change the direction of motion in 3D, but also to remain suspended near the bottom surface and, therefore, to maintain the swimming behavior in the presence of significant buoyancy forces.\nMuscular System of \nC. elegans\n Is Compatible with 3D Body Actuation, but Neural Control Mechanism Is Unknown.\n\n\nAs an important application of this study, our results may shed light on subtle aspects of neuromuscular control of 3D locomotion of \nC. elegans\n. Body movements of \nC. elegans\n are actuated by a coordinated action of four quadrants of body muscles, which are arranged into double rows that span the entire nematode length (\n53\n). While this muscle anatomy is compatible with 3D body actuation, it is less clear how the neural system can activate differential muscle contractions needed to generate 3D body deformations out of the dorsoventral undulation plane.\n\n\nAccording to a detailed map of neural connections in \nC. elegans\n (\n53\n–\n55\n), the head and neck body muscles are innervated by the nerve ring motor neurons, which synapse onto cells in individual quadrants (and thus are capable to actuate each quadrant individually). In contrast, the remaining body muscles are innervated only by the ventral-cord motor neurons, which synapse onto muscles of either two ventral or two dorsal quadrants, consistent with 2D actuation.\n\n\nBased on this topology of neural connections, it is generally assumed that only the head and neck segments can perform 3D motion. However, the stereoscopic experiments by Kwon et al. (\n33\n) clearly show that burrowing nematodes can adopt a variety of 3D postures. The images clearly show that the entire body undergoes out-of-plane deformations. In the swimming case the evidence is less conclusive because stereoscopic images are not yet available. Nonetheless, 2D images of swimming nematodes (such as the one shown in \nFig. 8\nA\n) agree with our 3D body posture model.\n\n\nOur hydrodynamic calculations of the roll dynamics further support a conclusion that the entire nematode body participates in generating the roll motion. We find that the torsional wave propagating throughout the entire body length can produce a 90° roll in less than one undulation period, consistent with rolls observed in our laboratory experiments using wild-type \nC. elegans\n. In contrast, a stroke in which only the head and neck segments are displaced out of the undulation plane produces significantly weaker rolls. The results of these additional simulations are presented in \nAnalysis of a Roll Resulting from Out-of-Plane Displacements of the Nematode Head\n.\n\n\nWe hypothesize that the generation of a nonzero torsion in the posterior part of the nematode body involves a 3D proprioceptive feedback, which enables propagation of the torsional wave from the head segment in the posterior direction. The existence of 2D proprioceptive feedback in \nC. elegans\n and its important role in generation of a planar undulation wave have been demonstrated by Wen et al. (\n4\n). Based on this result and building on their observation that individual neurons of \nC. elegans\n may have a high degree of functional complexity, we conjecture that 3D proprioception may give rise to asymmetric neural signals and differential muscular contractions that are needed to achieve well-controlled out-of-plane body movements during the torsional roll.\n\n\nWe note that current evidence is not sufficient to rule out a passive, purely mechanical origin of propagation of 3D deformations along the portion of the nematode body outside the head and neck regions. In particular, the body shapes observed during burrowing (\n33\n) can, in principle, be generated by 3D actuation of the head and neck muscles, with the rest of the body passively sliding along the tunnel carved by the nematode head. Such motion, however, would be inefficient, especially in media with low-yield stress, in which transverse forces needed to passively deform the nematode body would result in undesirable transverse slip.\n\n\nSince \nC. elegans\n has a four-quadrant muscle arrangement that is anatomically capable of generating 3D body deformations, we expect that there is a compatible neuromuscular-control system that allows the nematode to fully use this (existing) muscle structure. Further analyses of 3D locomotion of \nC. elegans\n will help determine whether such a control system exists and how it may actuate the nematode body.",

The rolls allow the worms to repeatedly attain approximately vertical orientation of the undulation plane (\nMovie S6\n). Such a vertical orientation is necessary for the sedimenting worms to be able to generate the upward resuspending force through collisions with the bottom. We thus conclude that the roll maneuvers are used by \nC. elegans\n not only to change the direction of motion in 3D, but also to remain suspended near the bottom surface and, therefore, to maintain the swimming behavior in the presence of significant buoyancy forces.",
    "muscular_system_of_c._elegans_is_compatible_with_3d_body_act": "As an important application of this study, our results may shed light on subtle aspects of neuromuscular control of 3D locomotion of \nC. elegans\n. Body movements of \nC. elegans\n are actuated by a coordinated action of four quadrants of body muscles, which are arranged into double rows that span the entire nematode length (\n53\n). While this muscle anatomy is compatible with 3D body actuation, it is less clear how the neural system can activate differential muscle contractions needed to generate 3D body deformations out of the dorsoventral undulation plane.\nAccording to a detailed map of neural connections in \nC. elegans\n (\n53\n–\n55\n), the head and neck body muscles are innervated by the nerve ring motor neurons, which synapse onto cells in individual quadrants (and thus are capable to actuate each quadrant individually). In contrast, the remaining body muscles are innervated only by the ventral-cord motor neurons, which synapse onto muscles of either two ventral or two dorsal quadrants, consistent with 2D actuation.\nBased on this topology of neural connections, it is generally assumed that only the head and neck segments can perform 3D motion. However, the stereoscopic experiments by Kwon et al. (\n33\n) clearly show that burrowing nematodes can adopt a variety of 3D postures. The images clearly show that the entire body undergoes out-of-plane deformations. In the swimming case the evidence is less conclusive because stereoscopic images are not yet available. Nonetheless, 2D images of swimming nematodes (such as the one shown in \nFig. 8\nA\n) agree with our 3D body posture model.\nOur hydrodynamic calculations of the roll dynamics further support a conclusion that the entire nematode body participates in generating the roll motion. We find that the torsional wave propagating throughout the entire body length can produce a 90° roll in less than one undulation period, consistent with rolls observed in our laboratory experiments using wild-type \nC. elegans\n. In contrast, a stroke in which only the head and neck segments are displaced out of the undulation plane produces significantly weaker rolls. The results of these additional simulations are presented in \nAnalysis of a Roll Resulting from Out-of-Plane Displacements of the Nematode Head\n.\nWe hypothesize that the generation of a nonzero torsion in the posterior part of the nematode body involves a 3D proprioceptive feedback, which enables propagation of the torsional wave from the head segment in the posterior direction. The existence of 2D proprioceptive feedback in \nC. elegans\n and its important role in generation of a planar undulation wave have been demonstrated by Wen et al. (\n4\n). Based on this result and building on their observation that individual neurons of \nC. elegans\n may have a high degree of functional complexity, we conjecture that 3D proprioception may give rise to asymmetric neural signals and differential muscular contractions that are needed to achieve well-controlled out-of-plane body movements during the torsional roll.\nWe note that current evidence is not sufficient to rule out a passive, purely mechanical origin of propagation of 3D deformations along the portion of the nematode body outside the head and neck regions. In particular, the body shapes observed during burrowing (\n33\n) can, in principle, be generated by 3D actuation of the head and neck muscles, with the rest of the body passively sliding along the tunnel carved by the nematode head. Such motion, however, would be inefficient, especially in media with low-yield stress, in which transverse forces needed to passively deform the nematode body would result in undesirable transverse slip.\nSince \nC. elegans\n has a four-quadrant muscle arrangement that is anatomically capable of generating 3D body deformations, we expect that there is a compatible neuromuscular-control system that allows the nematode to fully use this (existing) muscle structure. Further analyses of 3D locomotion of \nC. elegans\n will help determine whether such a control system exists and how it may actuate the nematode body.",
    "materials_and_methods": "Imaging of Swimming Nematodes Performing Rolls and Turns in Water.\n\n\nWild-type \nC. elegans\n were used to record the 3D swimming. Worms were cultured in a nematode growth medium plate seeded with the bacteria \nEscherichia coli\n OP50 at 20 °C. A liquid pool was created for the swimming assay by adding 5–7 mL of M9 buffer into a 60-mm Petri dish. The pool height was \n∼\n2 mm. The surface of the Petri dish was treated with 5% Pluoronic F127 for 5 min before adding M9 buffer. Individual young adults were manually transferred into a liquid pool of M9 buffer, using a worm pick. Swimming episodes were recorded at 30 frames per second using an SVSI camera and Zeiss Stemi 2000-C stereo microscope imaging system at 1.6× magnification with a pixel resolution of 0.21 pixels/\nμ\nm. All imaging was carried out in a food-free environment at 20 °C.\nAssessing Buoyancy Effects in 3D Swimming.\n\n\nA mixed culture of worms (L1–L3 larvae and adults) was used to observe the voluntary 3D movement of sedimenting nematodes in water and in 10% dextran solution (Dextran 2000 from \nLeuconostoc\n spp.) of viscosity 50.2 cP at 20 °C. Settling of a mixed worm population was observed in a BrandTech Macro Cuvette. Worms were washed from a plate and concentrated in 200 \nμ\nL of M9 solution. In each experiment, 50 \nμ\nL of the worm solution (\n∼\n50–100 worms) was added at the top surface of the fluid in the cuvette and allowed to settle under the influence of gravity. Worms were recorded for the entire settling path (4.5 cm).\n\n\nWe observed that in water the sedimentation velocity of adult worms was comparable to the active swimming velocity, and the nematodes settled toward the bottom of the cuvette. In contrast, many larvae did not settle and remained in the top layer of fluid even after 10 min. In the dextran solution the settling velocity was negligible for both adults and larvae. Nematodes changed the undulation plane using roll maneuvers every 2 to 3 undulations. The rate of planar turns was much slower (\n∼\n10 undulations per turn, consistent with results from ref. \n34\n). No evidence of gravity-induced passive reorientations was found in either experiment; therefore we conclude that the effect of buoyancy forces on reorientation maneuvers is negligible.\nDescription of Planar Nematode Postures.\n\n\nBased on our prior quantitative analysis of nematode shapes (\n28\n), in our turn and roll-rotation angle calculations we use \nq\nL\n=\n9\n for the \nW\n-shaped basic crawling/burrowing gait and \nq\nL\n=\n5.5\n for the \nC\n-shaped swimming gait. These values are within the range of wavelength variability reported in ref. \n25\n. Since in crawling and burrowing without transverse slip the resistance forces are of the same magnitude, we assume that the 3D burrowing and crawling gaits have similar parameter values, consistent with the available experimental images of burrowing \nC. elegans\n (\n33\n).\nModeling of Nematode Hydrodynamics.\n\n\nIn our numerical simulations of swimming nematodes we use a 3D generalization of the bead-based model introduced in ref. \n29\n.
