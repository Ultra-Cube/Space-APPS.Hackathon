    "abstract": "A plant’s oxygen supply can vary from normal (normoxia) to total depletion (anoxia). Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice (\nOryza sativa\n) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood. Four functional \nca\ntion/proton e\nx\nchangers (CAX1–4) in Arabidopsis (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n) help regulate Ca homeostasis around the vacuole. Our results demonstrate that \ncax1\n mutants are more tolerant to both anoxic conditions and submergence. Using phenotypic measurements, RNA-sequencing, and proteomic approaches, we identified \ncax1\n-mediated anoxia changes that phenocopy changes present in anoxia-tolerant crops: altered metabolic processes, diminished reactive oxygen species production post anoxia, and altered hormone signaling. Comparing wild-type and \ncax1\n expressing genetically encoded Ca indicators demonstrated altered cytosolic Ca signals in \ncax1\n during reoxygenation. Anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole are involved in the control of numerous signaling events related to adaptation to low oxygen stress. This work suggests that \ncax1\n anoxia response pathway could be engineered to circumvent the adverse effects of flooding that impair production agriculture.",
    "introduction": "Plants are frequently exposed to limited oxygen availability, influencing plant growth and, in an agricultural context, plant productivity (\nLoreti et al., 2016\n; \nPedersen et al., 2017\n; \nSchmidt et al., 2018\n). The lack of oxygen (anoxia) reduces plant energy production (\nRawyler et al., 2002\n). To survive and limit post-anoxic injuries, plants often regulate the flow of the little energy produced under stress conditions to essential processes (\nBlokhina et al., 2001\n; \nVirolainen et al., 2002\n; \nHuang et al., 2008\n; \nAtwell et al., 2015\n). In a natural context, submergence leads to multiple abiotic stress-related constraints, including limited light availability and the occurrence of oxidative stress either during or after the period of hypoxic conditions (\nSasidharan et al., 2018\n). Plants respond to submergence by responding to ethylene, which accumulates in plant tissues because of the lower underwater gas diffusion rate. The perception and response to cellular oxygen (O\n2\n) levels per se is mediated by a subset of ethylene response factors (ERFs) belonging to the group VII of this large class of transcription factors (ERF-VII; \nGibbs et al., 2015\n). ERF-VIIs induce a set of genes which are required to adapt plant metabolism and growth during low O\n2\n conditions (\nPaul et al., 2016\n). Calcium (Ca) signaling is another, less studied, component of plant responses to hypoxia (\nIgamberdiev and Hill, 2018\n; \nHuang et al., 2022\n). Ca signaling was proposed to control the induction of hypoxia-responsive genes (HRGs) and this would imply a cross-talk of this signaling pathway with the ERF-VII-dependent regulation of HRGs (\nSubbaiah et al., 1994\n), although this is not yet been demonstrated. In response to changes in O\n2\n levels, Ca signaling differs among plants, with marked differences between Arabidopsis (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n) and rice (\nOryza sativa\n) in the spatiotemporal parameters of the observed Ca signatures (\nBailey-Serres and Chang, 2005\n; \nBehera et al., 2015\n). Ca signaling differences appear to precede gene expression differences and metabolic fluxes, although precisely how Ca is triggering downstream events remains unclear (\nSchmidt et al., 2018\n). Conceptualizing signaling events involved in anoxia perception and tolerance might be useful to improve plant performance both during and after anoxic conditions.\nCa is at the nexus between many facets of plant biology (\nAli et al., 2007\n; \nMa and Berkowitz, 2007\n; \nChoi et al., 2017\n; \nCosta et al., 2018\n; \nDemidchik et al., 2018\n). Ca transporters on various membranes help to orchestrate responses to stresses such as changes in temperature and anoxia (\nCatalá et al., 2003\n; \nWang et al., 2016\n; \nChoi et al., 2017\n; \nCosta et al., 2018\n; \nWeigand et al., 2021\n). Ca pumps and exchangers are found in multiple membrane systems, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), vacuole, and plasma membrane (PM; \nBlumwald and Poole, 1986\n). Ca pumps are considered low-capacity, high-affinity efflux systems, but within this broad group of transporters, H\n+\n/\nCa\n e\nX\nchangers (CAXs) are distinct because they have high capacity and low affinity (\nKong et al., 2020\n; \nTian et al., 2020\n). While both Ca pumps and CAXs remove Ca from the cytoplasm, their individual contributions to the control of the magnitude or duration of different stimulus-specific Ca signals remains enigmatic.\nThere are six CAXs in Arabidopsis, but only \nCAX1–4\n are expressed and appear to be predominately localized to the vacuole (\nManohar et al., 2011\n). \nCAX2\n and \nCAX4\n are expressed at lower levels in plants, and most of the research on Ca signaling and homeostasis in plants has focused on the more highly expressed \nCAX1\n and \nCAX3\n (29). \nCAX1\n is expressed in aerial tissue and is the dominant mechanism for Ca accumulation in the leaf (\nConn et al., 2011\n; \nWhitt et al., 2020\n); \nCAX3\n is primarily expressed in the roots (\nHocking et al., 2017\n). The absence of \nCAX1\n induces ectopic expression of other \nCAX\ns, which is often sufficient to maintain mesophyll cellular uptake of Ca from the apoplast (\nCheng et al., 2005\n). The numerous \ncax1\n lines characterized have subtle phenotypes throughout their life cycle and are virtually indistinguishable from controls in normal growth conditions (\nManohar et al., 2011\n). These subtle phenotypes could be due to the interplay between CAX transporters and other transporters; deletions in \nCAX1\n reduce vacuolar H\n+\n/Ca antiport activity by 50%, decrease vacuolar V-type proton ATPase activity by 40% and increase vacuolar Ca-ATPase activity by 36% (\nCheng et al., 2003\n).\nPlant responses to hypoxia and anoxia have been extensively studied (\nAtwell et al., 2015\n; \nVoesenek and Bailey-Serres, 2013\n; \nVoesenek et al., 2016\n); however, less is known about the contribution of Ca signaling processes governing a plant’s tolerance to low oxygen. Traditional approaches to study these events include differential gene expression studies and comparative genomic analysis (\nYeung et al., 2018\n). Here, our analysis focuses on \nCAX1\n, a gene that is neither highly expressed during oxygen stress conditions nor thought to be modified in plants adapted to oxygen limitations. We demonstrate that \ncax1\n plants are extremely tolerant to anoxia conditions and submergence. We established that during post anoxia, \ncax1\n showed reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; additionally, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed \ncax1\n plants displayed apparent changes in transcripts and proteins for Ca transport and numerous signaling pathways. We also investigated how \ncax1\n changed the amplitude and duration of Ca signals during reoxygenation. Our work highlights a central role of tonoplast localized H\n+\n/Ca\n2+\n transport in anoxia responses while further defining the molecular choreography of anoxia signaling.",
    "results": "CAX1 mediates tolerance to anoxia and submergence\n\n\nMultiple studies have shown that Ca-regulated transporters and proteins like calmodulin demonstrate modified expression during conditions of low O\n2\n (\nOtsuka et al., 2010\n; \nLokdarshi et al., 2016\n; \nWang et al., 2016\n). We sought to clarify the role of \nCAX\n genes in anoxia tolerance using a seedling survival assay where plants are exposed to anoxic conditions for a period of time and survival monitored upon return to normoxic conditions (ambient air, i.e. ∼21% O\n2\n). In our assay, 21-day-old plants (nine rosette leaf development stage (\nBoyes et al., 2001\n) were placed in a GasPack anaerobic system that reduced O\n2\n levels in the experimental chamber to ∼0% (\nSupplemental Figure S1A\n). After anoxia, phenotypes of the \ncax\n lines relative to Col-0  plants were well-defined: the \ncax1\n lines (both \ncax1-1\n and \ncax1-2\n) were more tolerant to anoxic conditions and this phenotype was clearly visible 4 days after being removed from the anoxic chamber (\nFigure 1A\n). Chlorophyll loss measurements were made to compare the damage during reoxygenation among the tolerant and susceptible lines. At 24-h and 48-h post-anoxia, Col-0 and \ncax3\n displayed more chlorophyll loss, while both \ncax1\n alleles maintained their leaf chlorophyll content (\nFigure 1B; Liang et al., 2017\n). After these anoxic conditions, >80% of the \ncax1\n plants remained alive, whereas <15% of the \ncax3\n and Col-0 grew to maturity (\nSupplemental Figure S1, B and S1C\n). This tolerance was lost when \nCAX1\n driven by the \nCAX1\n promoter region was expressed in \ncax1-1\n (\nFigure 1C\n; \nSupplemental Figure S1D\n). Again, this susceptibility was verified by the loss of chlorophyll (\nFigure 1D\n). \ncax2\n, \ncax3\n, and \ncax4\n had instead similar anoxia phenotypes as Col-0 (\nSupplemental Figure S1E\n).\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nArabidopsis \ncax1\n lines are anoxia tolerant. A, Enhanced anoxia tolerance in \ncax1-1 and cax1-2\n compared to Col-0 and \ncax3\n. Twenty-one-day-old plants (nine-rosette leaf stage) were placed in a GasPack Anaerobic system. After 8 h, plants were returned to normoxia conditions and photographed after 4 days. Photographs represent more than 15 biological replicates in each condition. B, Post anoxia \ncax1\n exhibited less chlorophyll loss than Col-0 and \ncax3\n. Plants belonging to nine-rosette leaf stage were treated as described in \nFigure 1B\n and aerial portions of the plants were sampled 24 and 48 h after returning to normoxia conditions. Plants sampled prior to the anoxic conditions were used as controls. All results are means ± \nsem\n, \nn\n = 3 and error bars indicate standard error of the mean. Individual data points represented with a gray circle and asterisk indicate significant difference from the pre-treatment conditions at \nP\n =0.01, as calculated from Student’s \nt\n test in Excel. C, Expressing \nCAX1\n under the CAX1 promoter (\npcax1::CAX1\n) in \ncax1-1\n caused sensitivity to anoxia. Assay conditions similar to those described in (B). The data are a representative of 14 different transgenic lines analyzed. D, Chlorophyll loss following anoxia in two \ncax1-1\n lines expressing \nCAX1\n under its native promoter (\npcax1::CAX1#1\n, \npcax1::CAX1#2\n). The data are a representative of 14 different transgenic lines analyzed. Individual data values from three biological replicates are represented with a grey circle and error bars indicate standard error of the mean. Student’s \nt\n test was used to calculate the statistical significance and an asterisk indicates a \nP\n ≤0.001. The increase in \nCAX1\n expression in the transgenic lines has been confirmed by RT–qPCR as shown in \nSupplemental Figure S1E\n. Assay conditions similar to those described in (B) and (C).\nWe investigated if knockingout \nCAX1\n resulted in enhanced tolerance to submergence and waterlogging in adult Arabidopsis plants grown in soil. Although \ncax1\n growth rate was initially reduced compared to the Col-0, it reached a similar size when grown in air. When plants were submerged for 48 h, followed by 7 days of aerobic recovery, Col-0 plants displayed stunted growth (\nFigure 2A\n; \nSupplemental Figure S2\n), indicating that the length of oxygen deprivation was long enough to severely affect the ability of the plants to recover from the stress. Remarkably, \ncax1\n was extremely tolerant to submergence, showing none of the symptoms of prolonged hypoxia, namely inability to recover from the submergence treatment and yellowing. Both these parameters were quantified utilizing a phenotyping setup (\nVentura et al., 2020\n), as described in \nFigure 2, B and C\n. Similar to the Col-0, the \ncax3\n mutant was also intolerant, as was a \nCAX1\n complementation line (\ncax1:sCAX1 in cax1-1\n).\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nEffect of mutations in \nCAX\n genes on submergence tolerance. A, Photographs of representative plants (≥18 plants) after 48 h of submergence followed by 7 days of aerobic recovery. B, Rosette area shown as PLA ratio of plants after 48 h of submergence followed by 7 days of aerobic recovery. The ratio has been obtained between the PLA values of individual plants subjected to submergence and the average area value of aerobic plants. C, Color (HUE) of plants after 48 h of submergence followed by 7 days of aerobic recovery. In the box-blots, the dots represent the single data points, whiskers denote the min/max values, the box defines the interquartile range, center represents the median, box bounds represent the lower and upper quartiles (at least 15 biological replicates). Different letters indicate significant difference (\nP\n < 0.05) after Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test. Outliers have been identified using GraphPad 8.0.1 software (\nQ\n = 0.1%) and removed from the plots.\nNext, we explored the possibility that mutations in \nCAX1\n would also result in a tolerant phenotype to waterlogging, whereby only the root system is submerged. This is of interest, given that \nCAX1\n is predominantly expressed in leaves and \nCAX3\n in roots. The phenotype of all genotypes under waterlogging were similar, with enhanced anthocyanin synthesis in the leaves (\nFigure 3A\n). The growth of all genotypes stopped under waterlogging (\nFigure 3B\n). The size of \ncax1-1\n plants was slightly smaller than the other genotypes under waterlogging (\nFigure 3C\n), while the leaf color of \ncax1-1\n turned from red to yellowish (\nFigure 3D\n). Overall, while tolerance to submergence was greatly enhanced in \ncax1-1\n, \nCAX1\n seems to have a limited role in oxygen deprivation when it is restricted to the root system.\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nEffect of mutations in \nCAX\n genes on waterlogging tolerance. A, Photographs of representative plants (≥17 plants) after 2 weeks of waterlogging. B, Rosette area shown as PLA of control and waterlogged plants for each genotype. Student’s \nt\n test: *\nP\n ≤ 0.05; error bars: standard deviation from mean. C, PLA ratio of plants after 2 weeks of waterlogging. The ratio has been obtained between the PLA values of individual plants subjected to waterlogging and the average area value of aerobic plants. D, Color (HUE) of plants after 2 weeks of waterlogging. In the box-blots, the dots represent the single data points, whiskers denote the min/max values, the box defines the interquartile range, center represents the median, box bounds represent the lower and upper quartiles (at least 20 biological replicates). Different letters indicate significant difference (\nP\n < 0.05) after Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test. GraphPad 8.0.1 software (\nQ\n = 0.1%) did not identify any outliers and hence all the data points are all represented in the plot.\nCAX1 controls post-anoxia production of reactive oxygen species\n\n\nGiven that CAX transporters have been shown to play various roles in altering plant signaling (\nShigaki and Hirschi, 2006\n), we sought to assess its impact on anoxic responses. Oxidative-stress-induced lipid peroxidation (by malondialdehyde measurement in leaves) was elevated in Col-0 and \ncax3\n at 8-h post-anoxia, but both \ncax1\n lines displayed lower lipid peroxidation (\nFigure 4A\n; \nSattler et al., 2006\n). Since ROS are important signal molecules mediating plant stress responses and have been closely linked to hypoxia response (\nChapman et al., 2019\n; \nWu et al., 2021\n), staining with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was performed (\nDaudi and O'Brien, 2012\n). Although the leaves often varied in their responses, the \ncax1\n lines consistently showed lower H\n2\nO\n2\n accumulation (\nFigure 4B\n). We also measured hydrogen peroxide levels using the cell permeable dye H\n2\nDCFDA in plants exposed to anoxic conditions or to normoxia (\nFichman et al., 2019\n). Although there was also variability among the leaves, Col-0 and \ncax3\n plants generally displayed elevated H\n2\nO\n2\n post anoxia while \ncax1\n displayed lower levels (\nFigure 4C\n). Trypan blue staining of seedlings was performed to investigate cell death during the anoxia stress response. We observed a mild degree of cell death in standard aerobic conditions. Post anoxia, Col-0 and \ncax3\n mutants displayed significantly greater cell death throughout the leaves, compared to \ncax1\n (\nFigure 4D\n), which also showed greater survival at the whole plant level.\n\n\nFigure 4.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nEffect of mutations in \nCAX\n genes on post-anoxia production of reactive oxygen species. A, Col-0 and cax3 displayed higher induction of lipid peroxidation as measured by MDA. Plants belonging to nine-rosette leaf stage were treated as described in \nFigure 1B\n and aerial portions of the plants were sampled 1 h and 8 after returning to normoxia conditions. Plants sampled prior to the anoxic conditions were used as controls. All results are means ± \nsem\n, \nn\n = 3. Asterisk indicate significant differences compared to pre-anoxia conditions at \nP\n < 0.01, as calculated from Student’s \nt\n test in Excel. B, Reduced H\n2\nO\n2\n in \ncax1\n compared to Col-0 and \ncax3\n when recovering from anoxia as measured via DAB staining. A dark brown precipitate indicates the presence of H\n2\nO\n2\n. Whole rosettes from 3-week-old plants were exposed to anoxic conditions for 7 h. Rosettes were sampled 36 h after the plants were brought back to normoxia growth conditions. Unstressed plants were used as the control. Although there is variability among plants of the same genotype, the results were consistent. These data are representative of more than three independent experiments. C, Col-0 and \ncax3\n plants demonstrated elevated H\n2\nO\n2\n fluorescence using the cell permeable dye H\n2\nDCFDA in rosette leaves post anoxia compared to cax1. In the presence of ROS, H\n2\nDCF is oxidized to DCF, giving the fluorescence in Col-0 and \ncax3\n. Three-week-old plants were exposed to anoxic conditions for 8 h in dark. Following anoxia stress, mature whole rosette leaves were detached from the plants and were used for staining, Scale bar = 250 µM. Fluorescence signals quantified by ImageJ are given in the lower panel. Asterisks indicate significant differences compared to pre-anoxic conditions using Student’s \nt\n test in Excel (*\nP\n < 0.05 and **\nP\n < 0.005). Although there is variability among plants, the trends were consistent. Data are a representative three independent experiments and error bars indicate standard error of the mean. D, Cell death in leaves as measured by trypan blue staining was higher in Col-0 and cax3 post anoxia compared to cax1. Plants belonging to nine-rosette leaf stage were subject to anoxia as described in \nFigure 1A\n and leaves were sampled 7 h after the plants were returned to normoxia. Nine leaves were used to quantify the cell death intensity. The letters indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between two columns (level of significance 95%) as calculated from Student’s \nt\n test in Excel. Error bars indicate standard error from mean.\nRNA-sequencing reveals \ncax1\n changes in transcripts during anoxia and post-anoxia\n\n\nTo identify molecular processes contributing to the observed difference between the sensitive lines (Col-0, \ncax3\n) and the tolerant line (\ncax1-1\n), the leaves of 21-day-old plants (nine-rosette leaf stage) were subject to RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis before, during, and after anoxic conditions (Safavi-Rizi et al., XXXX). Leaves were harvested from plants at the start of the treatment (0-h control-pre), after being in the anoxia chamber for 4 h (anoxia) and 1-h post 7-h anoxia treatment (post-anoxia; \nFigure 5\n). Each library consisted of at least 38 million reads mapped to the Col-0 genome. A large number of genes responded significantly to both treatments (anoxia and post-anoxia; \nSupplemental Figure S3\n). In Col-0, 5,292 genes were upregulated during anoxia, while 6,216 genes were downregulated. Post anoxia, 5,025 genes were upregulated and 5,050 genes downregulated (\nSupplemental Figure S3A\n). Enriched gene ontology (GO) categories for the genes up- and downregulated demonstrates that the anoxic conditions resulted in responses similar to those from previous hypoxia studies (\nvan Veen et al., 2016\n; \nYeung et al., 2018\n; \nSupplemental Tables S1–S12\n and \nSupplemental Figure S4\n). Treatments and mutants clearly clustered separately in a principal component analysis (PCA) plot showing the first and second PCs which together explained 56.4% of variances, suggesting the RNA-seq was likely revealing differences between responses in the various genotypes (\nFigure 5A\n). We validated the RNA-seq data for several of the genes using reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR; \nSupplemental Figure S5\n).\n\n\nFigure 5.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nCAX mutants transcriptome-wide responses to anoxia. A, PCA representation of Col-0, \ncax1\n, and \ncax3\n transcriptomes before, during, and after anoxic treatment. B, GO groups identified in \ncax1\n pre-anoxia that overlap with genes differentially expressed in col-0 and \ncax3\n during anoxia (4-h) and post anoxia (1 h post 7-h anoxia). C, Bar graph denotes the upregulated HRGs downstream to ERFVII in pre-anoxic conditions. D, Substantially differential expression GO groups specifically found in \ncax1\n after 4 h of anoxia. E, Preferential upregulation of genes involved in photosystem maintenance and cax1 following anoxia. F, Preferential upregulation of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism in cax1 following anoxia. Fold change expression of the genes were used for constructing heat map using MeV_4_9_0 in both (c) and (F). G, Substantially differential expression GO groups specifically found in cax1 during post-anoxic conditions. H, Scheme and timing of leaf tissue harvesting for RNA-seq analysis. Plants belonging to nine rosette leaf stage were taken for RNA-seq analysis before anoxia (pre-conditions), after 4 h of anoxia (anoxia), and 1 h after a 7-h anoxia treatment (post anoxia).\nWe posited that enhanced expression or repression of specific genes prior to the stress could prime \ncax1\n for tolerance (\ncax1\n 1,423 genes upregulated–146 genes downregulated; \ncax3\n 526 genes upregulated–167 downregulated; \nFigure 5\n; \nSupplemental Figure S3B\n and \nSupplemental Tables S13–S15\n). We thus asked if any of the genes highly differentially expressed in \ncax1\n in conditions (\nFigure 5B\n) were genes highly differentially expressed in Col-0 during anoxic or post-anoxic conditions (\nSupplemental Figure S6\n and \nSupplemental Tables S15–S21\n). This proved to be true. Of the 1,423 genes upregulated in \ncax1\n pre-anoxia, ∼50% of these genes (717) were upregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia (\nSupplemental Figure S6A\n and \nSupplemental Table S16\n). The gene concept network indicates that specifically up- and downregulated genes could be assigned to different clusters. The upregulated genes appear to be involved in root morphogenesis and cellular response to hypoxia (\nSupplemental Figure S6B\n). Only 34 genes were downregulated in \ncax1\n with 80% (\nKong et al., 2020\n) of these downregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia. These overlapping genes appeared to be involved in cold acclimation and photosynthesis (\nSupplemental Figure S6, C\n and \nS6D\n and \nSupplemental Table S17\n). Meanwhile, the sensitive \ncax3\n line displayed 141 genes upregulated during normoxia and 33% (41 genes) were upregulated in Col-0 with many of these overlapping genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and root morphogenesis (\nSupplemental Figure S6, I and S6J\n and \nSupplemental Table S18\n). In terms of downregulated genes, 32 genes in \ncax3\n were downregulated during normoxia, and 66% (\nWang et al., 2016\n) were also downregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia. These overlapping genes were involved in cold acclimation, defense responses, and leaf senescence (\nSupplemental Figure S6, K and S6L\n and \nSupplemental Table S19\n).\n\n\nSome of the ERF-VIIs target genes were expressed in \ncax1\n prior to the stress (\nFigure 5, B and C\n). These ERF-VIIs are plant-specific transcription factors that are important regulators of low oxygen tolerance (\nGibbs et al., 2015\n). Previously, a core hypoxia-specific gene set (\nn\n ≈ 49) have been identified that are primary targets of ERF-VIIs (\nMustroph et al., 2009\n; \nGasch et al., 2016\n). In \ncax1\n, 17 of these genes were substantially expressed at a higher level in \ncax1\n even under aerobic conditions, indicating that the altered Ca homeostasis in \ncax1\n influences the ERF-VII-dependent gene expression, even prior to anoxia stress (\nFigure 5C\n; \nSupplemental Table S20\n); in contrast, \ncax3\n expressed only four of these genes at high levels prior to the stress (\nFigure 5C\n; \nSupplemental Table S20\n). This observation is consistent with the concept that \ncax1\n is primed for low-oxygen environments during normal growth conditions. However, analysis of the expression of all the 49 core anaerobic genes revealed a marked dampening of the expression of these HRGs during anoxia (\nFigure 5D\n; \nSupplemental Figure S7\n). Indeed, \ncax1-1\n only showed a modest induction of most of the 49 core HRGs, indicating that \nCAX1\n is required to ensure a normal expression of the ERF-VII-dependent HRGs. This suggests that the tolerance to anoxia and submergence observed in \ncax1-1\n may not be mediated by the ERF-VII-dependent pathway.\n\n\nDuring the anoxia phase, \ncax1-1\n also displayed heightened expression of metabolic and photosystem genes (\ncax1\n 2,000 genes upregulated–2,225 downregulated; \nFigure 5, D–F\n; \nSupplemental Figure S3B\n). Apparently, the loss of CAX1 caused substantial changes in the way the plant manages depleted light and energy levels.\n\n\nTo investigate \ncax1-1\n anoxia tolerance more thoroughly during the stress, 141 and 586 unique (not found in either \ncax3\n or Col-0) up- and downregulated were submitted for GO enrichment analysis (\nSupplemental Tables S21 and S22\n and \nSupplemental Figure S8\n). The genes clustered with oxidative stress, defense responses, and nitrogen and hydrocarbon metabolic processes (\nFigure 5D\n). In contrast, genes involved in cell signaling, response to photooxidative stress, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, were downregulated (\nSupplemental Figure S8B\n). These may be related to downregulated genes for plastid organization and chloroplast organization, which likely results in suppressed carbohydrate metabolism (\nSupplemental Figures S9 and S10\n). The cluster response to oxidative stress were connected to a number of genes that showed both up- and downregulation during anoxia.\n\n\nTo further conceptualize the \ncax1\n anoxia tolerance recovery phase (\ncax1\n 1,432 genes upregulated–2,464 downregulated), 131 and 751 unique (not found in either \ncax3\n or Col-0) up- and downregulated genes were also submitted for GO enrichment analysis (\nSupplemental Figure S3B\n and \nSupplemental Tables S23 and S24\n). The enriched GO category for these genes post-anoxia were predominately auxin-responsive genes, response to red light, and diterpenoid metabolism (\nFigure 5G\n). Meanwhile, the enriched GO category post-anoxia downregulated genes were cell wall biogenesis, anion transport, development, and cell growth related (\nSupplemental Figure S8C\n).\nProtein changes in \ncax1\n post anoxia\n\n\nTo provide additional insight into how the CAX proteins are involved in anoxia responses, global changes in protein abundance between Col-0, \ncax1\n, and \ncax3\n, pre- and post-anoxia were analyzed. In total, among the three genotypes, 463 unique proteins were identified from a total of 17,339 spectra. Normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) (\nZybailov et al., 2006\n) of each protein served as the basis for PCA. Clear separations were shown for clusters in accordance with genotypes and treatments represented by 95% confidence ellipses from three biological replicates, with only slight overlap between the clusters of Col-0 and \ncax1\n proteome post anoxia (\nFigure 6A\n).\n\n\nFigure 6.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nProteomic analysis of \ncax1\n post-anoxia treatment. A, PCA of the proteome of \nCol-0\n, \ncax1\n, and \ncax3\n pre (p) and post anoxia (a) conditions. Sample scores for the first and second principal components were plotted, the explained percentage of variance of PC1 and PC2 are indicated along the \nx\n and \ny\n axes. Clusters corresponding to the groups are represented by 95% confidence ellipses and include data from three biological replicates. The enlarged dots represent the means of the groups. Enrichment network depicting the top 20 most significantly enriched GO terms (hypergeometric test with Bonferroni correction, \nP\n < 0.05) for abundance increased (B) and decreased (C) proteins in Col-0, \ncax1\n, and \ncax3\n post anoxia. D, A combined GO enrichment study of transcriptomic and proteomic regulations in \ncax1\n post-anoxia treatment. Each GO term is represented by a circle, and different groups are shown. The size of the GO term circle reflects the number of genes/proteins enriched in the corresponding item. T-up/down, enriched GO terms for significantly up/downregulated transcripts; P-increased/decreased, enriched GO terms for significantly increased/decreased proteins.\nA total of 242, 218, and 356 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified for Col-0, \ncax1\n, and \ncax3\n post-anoxia treatment, respectively, based on their relative abundance, with details of increased and decreased proteins in each of the genotypes listed in \nSupplemental Table S25\n. DAPs in all three lines were subjected to enrichment analysis based on the functional annotation of GO terms. The top 20 significantly enriched GO terms (\np\nadj\n < 0.05, Bonferroni method) for increased and decreased proteins in all three lines (represented by different colors) are presented in \nFigure 6, B and C\n. The results suggested that increased proteins in all three lines were enriched in GO terms, including response to metal ion, photosynthesis, carbohydrate, and small molecule metabolic process, organic acid metabolic process, and sulfur compound metabolic process, while increased proteins from only \ncax1\n and \ncax3\n were enriched in carbon fixation, reductive pentose-phosphate cycle, and photosynthesis dark reaction (\nFigure 6B\n). In contrast, these GO terms were specifically enriched in Col-0 for proteins that had decreased abundance (\nFigure 6C\n). This is likely related to the decrease in proteins related to the GO term, chlorophyll metabolic processes, in this line which was also detected in the analysis as shown in \nFigure 6C\n.\n\n\nIn addition, although decreased proteins in all three lines were enriched in GO terms for translational elongation, only Col-0 showed enrichment in decreased proteins for GO terms related to protein modification, such as peptidyl-amino acid modifications and protein nitrosylation (\nFigure 6C\n). GO enrichment analyses of significantly decreased proteins in \ncax1\n, and \ncax3\n post anoxia also showed different clustering. For example, decreased proteins in \ncax1\n were enriched for processes including response to stimulus and ribosome biogenesis, while decreased proteins in \ncax3\n were enriched for metabolic processes (\nFigure 6C\n).\n\n\nA combined GO enrichment analysis of significantly altered transcripts and proteins provided insight into coordinated regulation occurring in \ncax1\n post-anoxia treatment and is demonstrated by overlapping of clusters of significantly enriched GO terms (\nFigure 6D\n; \nSupplemental Figure S11\n). This highlighted processes such as increased energy metabolism, represented by generation of precursor metabolites, energy derivation by the oxidation of organic compounds, as well as an increase in oxidative scavenging shown as response to oxidative stress, response to reactive oxygen species, and response to hydrogen peroxide in \ncax1\n post anoxia (\nFigure 6D\n; \nSupplemental Figure S11\n). Worth mentioning is that although proteomic analysis captured a decreased response to environmental stimulus such as chemical stress and salt stress (\nFigure 6, C and D\n), both transcriptomic and proteomic studies demonstrated an enrichment in GO terms for response to temperature (heat and cold) in \ncax1\n post anoxia.\nChanges in cytosolic Ca levels at the onset of anoxia and during recovery from anoxia in \ncax1\n\n\n\n\nCa plays an important role in plant sensing of external signals (\nSanders et al., 2002\n). CAX mutants may alter the distribution of Ca and thus influence anoxia responses. In order to investigate the relationship between CAX1 function and changes in cytosolic Ca and anoxia tolerance, we generated stable Col-0, \ncax3\n, and \ncax1\n lines expressing the Ca biosensor GCaMP3, a GFP-based fluorescent protein made Ca\n2+\n-sensitive by the insertion of a calmodulin domain (\nToyota et al., 2018\n). Under normal growth conditions, without anoxia stress, the Ca signals in Col-0 and \ncax1\n were similar (\nSupplemental Figure S12\n). After 4 h of anoxia treatment, these lines were reoxygenated and imaged for their cytosolic Ca signature. In this assay, it took ∼15–30 s to unseal the container and begin the imaging, once the imaging progressed, Col-0 lines showed a prominent initial Ca signal which dissipated within 90 s (\nFigure 7\n; \nSupplemental Movie 1\n); a second less prominent Ca signal peaked around 200- 300-s post reoxygenation depending on the organ monitored. In \ncax1\n, the initial cytosolic Ca signal seen to decline over the initial 90 s in the Col-0 was absent. Meanwhile, a stronger Ca signal peaked at around 100–200 s, which was especially evident in the younger leaves and meristematic region (\nFigure 7\n; \nSupplemental Movie 1\n). The spatial distribution of the signal also changed: the second Ca signal appeared to have a more pronounced temporal and spatial progression in \ncax1\n moving from the base of the meristem of the rosette along the petiole and into the leaf blade of the leaves. Although it is tempting to speculate that this represents a wave of response propagating outwards through the leaves, it is important to note that the reoxygenation post anoxia occurs plant wide and so these dynamics could equally report temporal differences in Ca signal generation in different parts of the plant.\n\n\nFigure 7.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nCalcium changes in Col-0 and \ncax1\n post anoxia. Plants were removed from their anoxic environment to normoxic conditions and then imaged using a fluorescence microscope.

Representative of ≥10 independent plants.\nInitial assessment for the roles of Ca signaling, ROS, and vacuolar function on anoxia tolerance\n\n\nPrevious studies on anoxia stress responses (\nLoreti and Perata, 2020\n) and our RNA-seq, proteomics, and Ca imaging suggest anoxia tolerance may involve vacuolar function, Ca signaling, pH homeostasis, and signaling pathways similar to those involved in abiotic and biotic stresses (\nVoesenek et al., 2016\n; \nSchmidt et al., 2018\n). To further investigate the roles of these processes, we assessed various T-DNA insertion lines with alterations in vacuolar function, pH homeostasis, Ca transport, stress, and ROS signaling for anoxia tolerance (\nTable 1\n; \nSupplemental Figure S13\n). Using a simple visual screen, lines with altered expression of a tonoplast localized Ca-ATPase (\nGeisler et al., 2000\n), Na/H transporters (\nReguera et al., 2015\n), and V-ATPase (\nKriegel et al., 2015\n) displayed no changes in anoxia tolerance (\nTable 1\n; \nSupplemental Figure S13\n). Additionally, mutations in genes related to Ca signaling, ROS, and defense signaling, despite showing changes in gene expression in \ncax1\n, had loss-of-function phenotypes that closely resembled Col-0 (\nSupplemental Table 26\n).\n\n\nTable 1.\n\n\nResponse of various lines previously identified as involved in altering Ca transport; production of ROS and regulation of vacuolar pH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSI.

    "cax1_mediates_tolerance_to_anoxia_and_submergence": "Multiple studies have shown that Ca-regulated transporters and proteins like calmodulin demonstrate modified expression during conditions of low O\n2\n (\nOtsuka et al., 2010\n; \nLokdarshi et al., 2016\n; \nWang et al., 2016\n). We sought to clarify the role of \nCAX\n genes in anoxia tolerance using a seedling survival assay where plants are exposed to anoxic conditions for a period of time and survival monitored upon return to normoxic conditions (ambient air, i.e. ∼21% O\n2\n). In our assay, 21-day-old plants (nine rosette leaf development stage (\nBoyes et al., 2001\n) were placed in a GasPack anaerobic system that reduced O\n2\n levels in the experimental chamber to ∼0% (\nSupplemental Figure S1A\n). After anoxia, phenotypes of the \ncax\n lines relative to Col-0  plants were well-defined: the \ncax1\n lines (both \ncax1-1\n and \ncax1-2\n) were more tolerant to anoxic conditions and this phenotype was clearly visible 4 days after being removed from the anoxic chamber (\nFigure 1A\n). Chlorophyll loss measurements were made to compare the damage during reoxygenation among the tolerant and susceptible lines. At 24-h and 48-h post-anoxia, Col-0 and \ncax3\n displayed more chlorophyll loss, while both \ncax1\n alleles maintained their leaf chlorophyll content (\nFigure 1B; Liang et al., 2017\n). After these anoxic conditions, >80% of the \ncax1\n plants remained alive, whereas <15% of the \ncax3\n and Col-0 grew to maturity (\nSupplemental Figure S1, B and S1C\n). This tolerance was lost when \nCAX1\n driven by the \nCAX1\n promoter region was expressed in \ncax1-1\n (\nFigure 1C\n; \nSupplemental Figure S1D\n). Again, this susceptibility was verified by the loss of chlorophyll (\nFigure 1D\n). \ncax2\n, \ncax3\n, and \ncax4\n had instead similar anoxia phenotypes as Col-0 (\nSupplemental Figure S1E\n).\nFigure 1.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nArabidopsis \ncax1\n lines are anoxia tolerant.

After 8 h, plants were returned to normoxia conditions and photographed after 4 days. Photographs represent more than 15 biological replicates in each condition. B, Post anoxia \ncax1\n exhibited less chlorophyll loss than Col-0 and \ncax3\n. Plants belonging to nine-rosette leaf stage were treated as described in \nFigure 1B\n and aerial portions of the plants were sampled 24 and 48 h after returning to normoxia conditions.

Assay conditions similar to those described in (B) and (C).\nWe investigated if knockingout \nCAX1\n resulted in enhanced tolerance to submergence and waterlogging in adult Arabidopsis plants grown in soil. Although \ncax1\n growth rate was initially reduced compared to the Col-0, it reached a similar size when grown in air. When plants were submerged for 48 h, followed by 7 days of aerobic recovery, Col-0 plants displayed stunted growth (\nFigure 2A\n; \nSupplemental Figure S2\n), indicating that the length of oxygen deprivation was long enough to severely affect the ability of the plants to recover from the stress. Remarkably, \ncax1\n was extremely tolerant to submergence, showing none of the symptoms of prolonged hypoxia, namely inability to recover from the submergence treatment and yellowing. Both these parameters were quantified utilizing a phenotyping setup (\nVentura et al., 2020\n), as described in \nFigure 2, B and C\n. Similar to the Col-0, the \ncax3\n mutant was also intolerant, as was a \nCAX1\n complementation line (\ncax1:sCAX1 in cax1-1\n).\nFigure 2.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nEffect of mutations in \nCAX\n genes on submergence tolerance.

This is of interest, given that \nCAX1\n is predominantly expressed in leaves and \nCAX3\n in roots. The phenotype of all genotypes under waterlogging were similar, with enhanced anthocyanin synthesis in the leaves (\nFigure 3A\n). The growth of all genotypes stopped under waterlogging (\nFigure 3B\n). The size of \ncax1-1\n plants was slightly smaller than the other genotypes under waterlogging (\nFigure 3C\n), while the leaf color of \ncax1-1\n turned from red to yellowish (\nFigure 3D\n). Overall, while tolerance to submergence was greatly enhanced in \ncax1-1\n, \nCAX1\n seems to have a limited role in oxygen deprivation when it is restricted to the root system.\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nEffect of mutations in \nCAX\n genes on waterlogging tolerance.

Since ROS are important signal molecules mediating plant stress responses and have been closely linked to hypoxia response (\nChapman et al., 2019\n; \nWu et al., 2021\n), staining with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was performed (\nDaudi and O'Brien, 2012\n). Although the leaves often varied in their responses, the \ncax1\n lines consistently showed lower H\n2\nO\n2\n accumulation (\nFigure 4B\n). We also measured hydrogen peroxide levels using the cell permeable dye H\n2\nDCFDA in plants exposed to anoxic conditions or to normoxia (\nFichman et al., 2019\n). Although there was also variability among the leaves, Col-0 and \ncax3\n plants generally displayed elevated H\n2\nO\n2\n post anoxia while \ncax1\n displayed lower levels (\nFigure 4C\n). Trypan blue staining of seedlings was performed to investigate cell death during the anoxia stress response. We observed a mild degree of cell death in standard aerobic conditions. Post anoxia, Col-0 and \ncax3\n mutants displayed significantly greater cell death throughout the leaves, compared to \ncax1\n (\nFigure 4D\n), which also showed greater survival at the whole plant level.\nFigure 4.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nEffect of mutations in \nCAX\n genes on post-anoxia production of reactive oxygen species.

    "rna-sequencing_reveals_cax1_changes_in_transcripts_during_an": "To identify molecular processes contributing to the observed difference between the sensitive lines (Col-0, \ncax3\n) and the tolerant line (\ncax1-1\n), the leaves of 21-day-old plants (nine-rosette leaf stage) were subject to RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis before, during, and after anoxic conditions (Safavi-Rizi et al., XXXX). Leaves were harvested from plants at the start of the treatment (0-h control-pre), after being in the anoxia chamber for 4 h (anoxia) and 1-h post 7-h anoxia treatment (post-anoxia; \nFigure 5\n). Each library consisted of at least 38 million reads mapped to the Col-0 genome. A large number of genes responded significantly to both treatments (anoxia and post-anoxia; \nSupplemental Figure S3\n). In Col-0, 5,292 genes were upregulated during anoxia, while 6,216 genes were downregulated. Post anoxia, 5,025 genes were upregulated and 5,050 genes downregulated (\nSupplemental Figure S3A\n). Enriched gene ontology (GO) categories for the genes up- and downregulated demonstrates that the anoxic conditions resulted in responses similar to those from previous hypoxia studies (\nvan Veen et al., 2016\n; \nYeung et al., 2018\n; \nSupplemental Tables S1–S12\n and \nSupplemental Figure S4\n). Treatments and mutants clearly clustered separately in a principal component analysis (PCA) plot showing the first and second PCs which together explained 56.4% of variances, suggesting the RNA-seq was likely revealing differences between responses in the various genotypes (\nFigure 5A\n). We validated the RNA-seq data for several of the genes using reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR; \nSupplemental Figure S5\n).\nFigure 5.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nCAX mutants transcriptome-wide responses to anoxia.

G, Substantially differential expression GO groups specifically found in cax1 during post-anoxic conditions. H, Scheme and timing of leaf tissue harvesting for RNA-seq analysis. Plants belonging to nine rosette leaf stage were taken for RNA-seq analysis before anoxia (pre-conditions), after 4 h of anoxia (anoxia), and 1 h after a 7-h anoxia treatment (post anoxia).\nWe posited that enhanced expression or repression of specific genes prior to the stress could prime \ncax1\n for tolerance (\ncax1\n 1,423 genes upregulated–146 genes downregulated; \ncax3\n 526 genes upregulated–167 downregulated; \nFigure 5\n; \nSupplemental Figure S3B\n and \nSupplemental Tables S13–S15\n). We thus asked if any of the genes highly differentially expressed in \ncax1\n in conditions (\nFigure 5B\n) were genes highly differentially expressed in Col-0 during anoxic or post-anoxic conditions (\nSupplemental Figure S6\n and \nSupplemental Tables S15–S21\n). This proved to be true. Of the 1,423 genes upregulated in \ncax1\n pre-anoxia, ∼50% of these genes (717) were upregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia (\nSupplemental Figure S6A\n and \nSupplemental Table S16\n). The gene concept network indicates that specifically up- and downregulated genes could be assigned to different clusters. The upregulated genes appear to be involved in root morphogenesis and cellular response to hypoxia (\nSupplemental Figure S6B\n). Only 34 genes were downregulated in \ncax1\n with 80% (\nKong et al., 2020\n) of these downregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia. These overlapping genes appeared to be involved in cold acclimation and photosynthesis (\nSupplemental Figure S6, C\n and \nS6D\n and \nSupplemental Table S17\n). Meanwhile, the sensitive \ncax3\n line displayed 141 genes upregulated during normoxia and 33% (41 genes) were upregulated in Col-0 with many of these overlapping genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and root morphogenesis (\nSupplemental Figure S6, I and S6J\n and \nSupplemental Table S18\n). In terms of downregulated genes, 32 genes in \ncax3\n were downregulated during normoxia, and 66% (\nWang et al., 2016\n) were also downregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia. These overlapping genes were involved in cold acclimation, defense responses, and leaf senescence (\nSupplemental Figure S6, K and S6L\n and \nSupplemental Table S19\n).\nSome of the ERF-VIIs target genes were expressed in \ncax1\n prior to the stress (\nFigure 5, B and C\n). These ERF-VIIs are plant-specific transcription factors that are important regulators of low oxygen tolerance (\nGibbs et al., 2015\n). Previously, a core hypoxia-specific gene set (\nn\n ≈ 49) have been identified that are primary targets of ERF-VIIs (\nMustroph et al., 2009\n; \nGasch et al., 2016\n). In \ncax1\n, 17 of these genes were substantially expressed at a higher level in \ncax1\n even under aerobic conditions, indicating that the altered Ca homeostasis in \ncax1\n influences the ERF-VII-dependent gene expression, even prior to anoxia stress (\nFigure 5C\n; \nSupplemental Table S20\n); in contrast, \ncax3\n expressed only four of these genes at high levels prior to the stress (\nFigure 5C\n; \nSupplemental Table S20\n). This observation is consistent with the concept that \ncax1\n is primed for low-oxygen environments during normal growth conditions. However, analysis of the expression of all the 49 core anaerobic genes revealed a marked dampening of the expression of these HRGs during anoxia (\nFigure 5D\n; \nSupplemental Figure S7\n). Indeed, \ncax1-1\n only showed a modest induction of most of the 49 core HRGs, indicating that \nCAX1\n is required to ensure a normal expression of the ERF-VII-dependent HRGs. This suggests that the tolerance to anoxia and submergence observed in \ncax1-1\n may not be mediated by the ERF-VII-dependent pathway.\nDuring the anoxia phase, \ncax1-1\n also displayed heightened expression of metabolic and photosystem genes (\ncax1\n 2,000 genes upregulated–2,225 downregulated; \nFigure 5, D–F\n; \nSupplemental Figure S3B\n). Apparently, the loss of CAX1 caused substantial changes in the way the plant manages depleted light and energy levels.\nTo investigate \ncax1-1\n anoxia tolerance more thoroughly during the stress, 141 and 586 unique (not found in either \ncax3\n or Col-0) up- and downregulated were submitted for GO enrichment analysis (\nSupplemental Tables S21 and S22\n and \nSupplemental Figure S8\n). The genes clustered with oxidative stress, defense responses, and nitrogen and hydrocarbon metabolic processes (\nFigure 5D\n). In contrast, genes involved in cell signaling, response to photooxidative stress, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, were downregulated (\nSupplemental Figure S8B\n). These may be related to downregulated genes for plastid organization and chloroplast organization, which likely results in suppressed carbohydrate metabolism (\nSupplemental Figures S9 and S10\n). The cluster response to oxidative stress were connected to a number of genes that showed both up- and downregulation during anoxia.\nTo further conceptualize the \ncax1\n anoxia tolerance recovery phase (\ncax1\n 1,432 genes upregulated–2,464 downregulated), 131 and 751 unique (not found in either \ncax3\n or Col-0) up- and downregulated genes were also submitted for GO enrichment analysis (\nSupplemental Figure S3B\n and \nSupplemental Tables S23 and S24\n). The enriched GO category for these genes post-anoxia were predominately auxin-responsive genes, response to red light, and diterpenoid metabolism (\nFigure 5G\n). Meanwhile, the enriched GO category post-anoxia downregulated genes were cell wall biogenesis, anion transport, development, and cell growth related (\nSupplemental Figure S8C\n).",

T-up/down, enriched GO terms for significantly up/downregulated transcripts; P-increased/decreased, enriched GO terms for significantly increased/decreased proteins.\nA total of 242, 218, and 356 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified for Col-0, \ncax1\n, and \ncax3\n post-anoxia treatment, respectively, based on their relative abundance, with details of increased and decreased proteins in each of the genotypes listed in \nSupplemental Table S25\n. DAPs in all three lines were subjected to enrichment analysis based on the functional annotation of GO terms. The top 20 significantly enriched GO terms (\np\nadj\n < 0.05, Bonferroni method) for increased and decreased proteins in all three lines (represented by different colors) are presented in \nFigure 6, B and C\n. The results suggested that increased proteins in all three lines were enriched in GO terms, including response to metal ion, photosynthesis, carbohydrate, and small molecule metabolic process, organic acid metabolic process, and sulfur compound metabolic process, while increased proteins from only \ncax1\n and \ncax3\n were enriched in carbon fixation, reductive pentose-phosphate cycle, and photosynthesis dark reaction (\nFigure 6B\n). In contrast, these GO terms were specifically enriched in Col-0 for proteins that had decreased abundance (\nFigure 6C\n). This is likely related to the decrease in proteins related to the GO term, chlorophyll metabolic processes, in this line which was also detected in the analysis as shown in \nFigure 6C\n.\nIn addition, although decreased proteins in all three lines were enriched in GO terms for translational elongation, only Col-0 showed enrichment in decreased proteins for GO terms related to protein modification, such as peptidyl-amino acid modifications and protein nitrosylation (\nFigure 6C\n). GO enrichment analyses of significantly decreased proteins in \ncax1\n, and \ncax3\n post anoxia also showed different clustering. For example, decreased proteins in \ncax1\n were enriched for processes including response to stimulus and ribosome biogenesis, while decreased proteins in \ncax3\n were enriched for metabolic processes (\nFigure 6C\n).\nA combined GO enrichment analysis of significantly altered transcripts and proteins provided insight into coordinated regulation occurring in \ncax1\n post-anoxia treatment and is demonstrated by overlapping of clusters of significantly enriched GO terms (\nFigure 6D\n; \nSupplemental Figure S11\n). This highlighted processes such as increased energy metabolism, represented by generation of precursor metabolites, energy derivation by the oxidation of organic compounds, as well as an increase in oxidative scavenging shown as response to oxidative stress, response to reactive oxygen species, and response to hydrogen peroxide in \ncax1\n post anoxia (\nFigure 6D\n; \nSupplemental Figure S11\n). Worth mentioning is that although proteomic analysis captured a decreased response to environmental stimulus such as chemical stress and salt stress (\nFigure 6, C and D\n), both transcriptomic and proteomic studies demonstrated an enrichment in GO terms for response to temperature (heat and cold) in \ncax1\n post anoxia.",

    "changes_in_cytosolic_ca_levels_at_the_onset_of_anoxia_and_du": "Ca plays an important role in plant sensing of external signals (\nSanders et al., 2002\n). CAX mutants may alter the distribution of Ca and thus influence anoxia responses. In order to investigate the relationship between CAX1 function and changes in cytosolic Ca and anoxia tolerance, we generated stable Col-0, \ncax3\n, and \ncax1\n lines expressing the Ca biosensor GCaMP3, a GFP-based fluorescent protein made Ca\n2+\n-sensitive by the insertion of a calmodulin domain (\nToyota et al., 2018\n). Under normal growth conditions, without anoxia stress, the Ca signals in Col-0 and \ncax1\n were similar (\nSupplemental Figure S12\n). After 4 h of anoxia treatment, these lines were reoxygenated and imaged for their cytosolic Ca signature. In this assay, it took ∼15–30 s to unseal the container and begin the imaging, once the imaging progressed, Col-0 lines showed a prominent initial Ca signal which dissipated within 90 s (\nFigure 7\n; \nSupplemental Movie 1\n); a second less prominent Ca signal peaked around 200- 300-s post reoxygenation depending on the organ monitored. In \ncax1\n, the initial cytosolic Ca signal seen to decline over the initial 90 s in the Col-0 was absent. Meanwhile, a stronger Ca signal peaked at around 100–200 s, which was especially evident in the younger leaves and meristematic region (\nFigure 7\n; \nSupplemental Movie 1\n). The spatial distribution of the signal also changed: the second Ca signal appeared to have a more pronounced temporal and spatial progression in \ncax1\n moving from the base of the meristem of the rosette along the petiole and into the leaf blade of the leaves. Although it is tempting to speculate that this represents a wave of response propagating outwards through the leaves, it is important to note that the reoxygenation post anoxia occurs plant wide and so these dynamics could equally report temporal differences in Ca signal generation in different parts of the plant.\nFigure 7.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nCalcium changes in Col-0 and \ncax1\n post anoxia.

To further investigate the roles of these processes, we assessed various T-DNA insertion lines with alterations in vacuolar function, pH homeostasis, Ca transport, stress, and ROS signaling for anoxia tolerance (\nTable 1\n; \nSupplemental Figure S13\n).

    "discussion": "Hypoxia exerts a negative impact on energy production (\nAtwell et al., 2015\n). Hypoxic events can be viewed as a sequential, compound stress, where both the lack of oxygen and the reoxygenation periods pose distinct stressors; lack of light exerts another stress, eventually leading to carbon starvation (\nLoreti et al., 2018\n). Tolerance is determined by the plant’s ability to acclimate to all these stresses (\nYeung et al., 2018\n). Plants may use spatial and temporal dynamics in Ca to convey information about anoxic conditions (\nFarnese et al., 2016\n; \nWang et al., 2016\n). Here, we identified CAX1 as a Ca transporter whose expression is detrimental to anoxic conditions and submergence (\nFigures 1\n and \n2\n). Using this mutant, we have sought to identify various molecular and physiological processes influencing anoxia tolerance.\nOur work suggests that \ncax1\n has numerous adaptations to endure anoxia stress (\nFigure 8\n): (1) The plant is primed for anoxia through altered expression of ROS, HRGs, and temperature perception genes (\nFigures 4\n and \n5\n; \nSupplemental Figures S6 and S13\n and \nSupplemental Table S20\n); (2) During anoxia, changes in light and carbohydrate metabolism may mitigate the stress (\nFigures 5\n and \n6\n); (3) Post anoxia, altered Ca signaling could help dissipate the reoxygenation stress (\nFigure 7\n). These findings suggest that altered tonoplast H\n+\n/Ca transport impacts an array of biological processes associated with anoxia (\nFigures 4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n and \n8\n); however, mutants in tonoplast localized Ca transporters with different transport kinetics did not impact anoxia tolerance (\nTable 1\n). The loss of high-capacity low-affinity Ca transport caused by disruption of CAX1 led to numerous changes in gene expression and protein abundance; the breadth of these changes makes the identification of a single causative pathway for this submergence/anoxia tolerance a challenging endeavor.\nFigure 8.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nModel comparing pre-anoxia and anoxia responses in CAX1 and \ncax1\n lines. Before anoxia, plants appear to have altered regulation of ERF-VII-targeted transcripts and stress response genes such as those involved in systemic-acquired resistance (SAR). During anoxia and post anoxia, \ncax1\n appears to have dampened ROS production, altered (Δ)Ca signaling, and differences in the expression of carbohydrate and metabolism genes.\nThe fact that a subset of HRGs is upregulated in normoxia in \ncax1\n, while most of the HRGs are downregulated during hypoxia is intriguing. This suggests that altered Ca homeostasis caused by perturbed CAX1 activates some HRGs, most likely though an ERF-VII-independent pathway, given that this class of transcription factors are highly unstable and thus inactive under aerobic conditions (\nWeits et al., 2014\n). Under hypoxia, instead, ERF-VII are stable because of the inability of plant cysteine oxidases to utilize molecular oxygen (\nWeits et al., 2014\n). Under these conditions, which promote a vigorous expression of ERF-VII-dependent HRGs, we observed a dampening of the response, which could be beneficial to preserve the carbon reserves required during the recovery phase. Monitoring the protein stability of ERF-VII (e.g. by western blot) as a consequence of CAX1-dependent alterations in Ca fluxes could be difficult but could shed light on the role of Ca on the stability of ERF-VII. Furthermore, future experiments with \nerfVII/cax1\n will be informative to define whether the tolerance in cax1 requires the activity of ERF-VIIs or it is an ERF-VII-independent mechanism of tolerance.\nAs the lack of a waterlogging phenotypes demonstrates, plant roots and shoots have different mechanisms for hypoxia/anoxia stress tolerance (\nEllis et al., 1999\n). Previous work in Arabidopsis has used tissue-specific root ion profiling to show roles of putative CAXs and Ca-ATPase transporters in hypoxia (\nWang et al., 2016\n). These studies demonstrated a gene termed CCX5 (misidentified as CAX11) was involved in hypoxia responses; 3 weeks of waterlogging resulted in dramatic loss of shoot biomass in \nccx5\n (\ncax11)\n plants. It is important to clarify here that CCX5 is not a CAX (\nShigaki et al., 2006\n) and is more closely related to mammalian K\n+\n-dependent Na\n+\n/Ca\n2+\n antiporters (\nPittman and Hirschi, 2016\n). Our results showed that the leaf-expressed CAX1 is detrimental for both anoxia and submergence tolerance (\nFigures 1\n and \n2\n). Furthermore, the expression of CAX1 in \ncax1-1\n suppressed these tolerance phenotypes (\nFigures 1\n and \n2\n). Waterlogging, which results in hypoxia restricted to the root system, provided support to the role of CAX1 limited to the aerial part of the plant (\nFigure 3\n). Additionally, CAX3 does not appear to be required for hypoxia signaling given that \ncax3\n remained sensitive to both submergence and waterlogging.\nIn \ncax1\n, signaling and metabolic mechanisms for anoxia tolerance are activated, suggesting that CAX1 plays a negative role in low oxygen tolerance (\nFigure 8\n). However, the mechanism by which the absence of this transporter positively impacts multiple biochemical mechanisms toward tolerance requires further research. In yeast, the tonoplast localized Ca/H\n+\n antiporter, VCX1, functions to rapidly sequester cytosolic Ca and attenuate the activation of Ca signaling pathways (\nMiseta et al., 1999\n). However, the relationship between Ca signaling and CAX1 during limited oxygen conditions is less clear. Defining this relationship is confounded by the variable Ca responses among leaves within the same plant. This work focused on the two older leaves in the four-leaf rosette stage in young plants, where the changes between \ncax1\n and Col-0 were most obvious. In \ncax1\n, during the first minute after exposure to oxygen, plants appeared to accumulate less cytosolic Ca in these leaves (\nFigure 7\n). One interpretation of this observation is that CAX1 has a minimal role in sequestering cytosolic Ca during this response as its loss would be expected to cause a larger Ca increase if it was removing signaling-related Ca from the cytosol. Indeed, such an increase in the magnitude of the pathogen elicitor-triggered Ca signal is seen when the two tonoplasts localized Ca\n2+\n-ATPases ACA4 and ACA 11 are knocked out, providing evidence that for these two pumps, they do normally act to attenuate the Ca signal (\nHilleary et al., 2020\n). From our results, it seems likely that CAX1 is instead functioning to create an exchangeable Ca store that can be drawn upon to generate signals, and this is lost in the mutant. Alternatively, \ncax1\n may cause compensatory upregulation of numerous endomembrane Ca transporters to diminish cytosolic Ca levels (\nCheng et al., 2003\n, \n2005\n). In yeast, the absence of Vcx1p results in heightened Ca-ATPase expression (\nCallewaert et al., 2020\n) and may result in the induction or activation of a set of transporters capable of coupling vacuolar Ca uptake to the vacuolar H\n+\n gradient (\nMiseta et al., 1999\n). Indeed, our analyses reveal significant (\nP\n < 0.01) constitutive transcriptional upregulation to more than two-fold of some classic Ca transporters including ACAs 1 and 9–13 in the \ncax1\n background and as noted above, ACA11 is thought to act to attenuate Ca signaling (\nHilleary et al., 2020\n). We also cannot discount activation of another transport system, or post-translational regulation of, for example the ACAs or CAXs playing an important role in these processes. Caution regarding ascribing any direct mechanistic relationship between \ncax1\n-mediated Ca levels and anoxia tolerance is also warranted. For example, the phenotype of anoxia tolerance displayed in the mutant could be caused by heightened H\n+\n pumping. For adequate energy production, residual H\n+\n pumping is critical to cope with anoxia by importing energy-rich compounds (\nFelle, 2005\n). The perturbation of Arabidopsis H\n+\n-ATPase activities at both the plasma membrane and tonoplast in mutants lacking tonoplast Ca/H\n+\n antiporters (\nPittman et al., 2005\n; \nBarkla et al., 2008\n) suggests future studies that address how \ncax1\n impacts transmembrane H\n+\n gradients during oxygen limiting conditions (\nReguera et al., 2015\n). This information may provide important insight into the molecular events underlying \ncax1\n tolerance.\nA limitation of our model (\nFigure 8\n) is its inability to address the known variability in anoxic responses among different tissues and leaves (\nBanti et al., 2013\n; \nKlecker et al., 2014\n; \nVentura et al., 2020\n). These differences were seen here in both the ROS and Ca imaging experiments (\nFigures 4\n and \n7\n). While the anoxic response is variable, the role of CAX1 in different tissues and leaves also fluctuates. In dicots, \nCAX1\n is found predominately in the tonoplast of mesophyll cells (\nConn et al., 2011\n). Each tissue will have a different proportion of mesophyll cells, and individual cells will have variations in vacuole size and shape (\nTan et al., 2019\n). Thus, there will be developmental and spatial differences in the contribution of CAX1 to Ca and H\n+\n fluxes. For example, in contrast to the major mesophyll expression observed in dicots, in monocots CAX1 is localized to epidermal cells (\nConn et al., 2011\n), we posit monocot loss-of-function mutants will show very different responses to anoxic conditions.\nLoss-of-function mutations in Arabidopsis H\n+\n/Ca transporter CAX1 display a robust conditional phenotype, they gain tolerance to anoxic conditions (\nFigure 1\n). The disruption of CAX transport during this stress impacts a myriad of cellular processes: cell wall biosynthesis, metabolism, ROS, hormone, and Ca signaling (\nFigure 5\n). Furthermore, the mutants appear to be primed for the stress by having heightened expression of ROS-related transcripts and diminished expression of cold tolerance genes during normal growth conditions (\nFigure 4\n; \nSupplemental Figure S6\n). The \ncax1\n lines also appear to be “warmed up” as they display heightened expression of heat-responsive transcripts during the anoxia recovery phase (\nSupplemental Figure S14\n). Heat shock response involves the induction of a wide range of molecular chaperones to aid in protecting and refolding damaged proteins and so this constitutive production of, for example heat shock proteins may equip cax1 with readymade machinery to cope with some of the cellular damage that anoxia and reoxygenation imposes. Previous work has also shown that \ncax1\n has altered cold-acclimation responses (\nCatalá et al., 2003\n) and temperature perception may be an important factor in our anoxia tolerance phenotype.",

    "conclusions": "This study adds granularity to the role of tonoplast localized Ca transport in plant stress responses. The \ncax1-\nmediated anoxia tolerance is caused by extensive changes in both metabolism and signaling. Indeed, one of the most important findings of this study is the breath and amplitude of changes caused by the loss of a single tonoplast H\n+\n/Ca transporter (\nFigures 5\n and \n6\n). To harness this knowledge for translational applications, judicious application is advised: CAX transporters impact a variety of plant signal transduction pathways (\nPittman and Hirschi, 2016\n; \nBradshaw, 2005\n; \nBaliardini et al., 2015\n, \n2016\n). However, the CAX transporters appear to be autoinhibited, requiring a protein partner for activation (\nShigaki and Hirschi, 2006\n). During anoxic conditions, CAX1 may be activated by a specific regulatory protein and downregulation of this activator during anoxic conditions may be a means of transiently impairing CAX1 function and improving anoxia tolerance.",
    "materials_and_methods": "Plant materials\n\n\nThe Arabidopsis (\nA. thaliana\n) Col-0 and \nCAX\n mutant seeds (\ncax1-1\n, cax1-2, \ncax3-1\n) and various CAX1 construct used in the study have been previously characterized (\nCatalá et al., 2003\n; \nCheng et al., 2005\n). In normal growth conditions, the \ncax1\n lines are virtually indistinguishable from Col-0 in terms of size and fertility (\nCheng et al., 2003\n). The \nCAX\n mutants were genotyped to confirm the presence of the T-DNA insertions. The plants expressing the binary construct harboring \np35S:sCAX1\n or \npCAX1::CAX1\n have both been previously described and growth and stress response phenotypes are similar to Col-0 (\nCheng et al., 2003\n; \nConn et al., 2011\n). Col-0 harboring a stable p35S::GCaMP3 Ca biosensor construct (\nToyota et al., 2018\n; GCamP3/Col-0) was crossed with \ncax1\n to obtain GCamP3/\ncax1\n. F3 plants that were verified as \ncax1-1\n were then assayed for expression of GCamP3.\nPlant growth, anoxia, and flooding treatment\n\n\nArabidopsis seeds were sterilized in 20% bleach (v/v) for 15 min before they were planted on 1/2X Murashige and Skoog (MS) media containing 0.8% agar (w/v) and 0.5% sucrose (w/v), and were grown under equal day/night light conditions (12-h light, 22°C, 180 μmol·m\n−2\n·s \n−1\n, and 12-h night 20°C). For anoxia treatments, 21-day-old plants (nine-rosette leaf developmental stage) were foil covered at 2:00 pm and then placed in a GasPak using anaerobic atmosphere generation bags (Sigma) for 7 h or an anoxia chamber (Anaerobe Systems, AS-580, Morgan Hill, CA, USA). After the treatment the plants are returned to the growth chamber. Images were taken 3 or 4 days after the anoxia treatment to assess plant tolerance.\n\n\nPlants for the submergence and waterlogging experiments were grown as described (\nVentura et al., 2020\n). Briefly, were grown in pots for 3–4 weeks at 23°C with a 12-/12-h photoperiod at 120 μmol photons m\n−2\n s\n−1\n before being used in our experiments. Waterlogging treatments were performed on 3-week-old plants, during which all the root system was immersed in water, but the leaves and petioles were above the water level. For the submergence experiments, the plants were submerged in tanks with a water level of 10-cm above leaf level. The submergence treatment was carried out in the dark (also the controls in air were in the dark), while waterlogged plants were kept under the normal day/night cycle.\nPlant phenotyping\n\n\nPlant trays were placed in a LabScanalyzer (LemnaTec, GmbH, Aachen, Germany) imaging box equipped with a Manta G-1236 camera (Allied Vision Technologies GmbH, Stadtroda, Germany) and a Kowa LM12XC lens (Kowa Optimed Deutschland GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany). Trays were illuminated by two cool white LED panels (polyscale GmbH & Co. KG, Aachen, Germany) mounted beside the camera at an angle of 30° to prevent direct reflection from the imaging area. The raw images acquired as previously described (\nVentura et al., 2020\n) and analyzed with LemnaGrid software (LemnaTec, GmbH, Aachen). The parameters measured were the projected leaf area (PLA, area of the rosette) and color (HUE) as described in \nVentura et al. (2020)\n. In order to allow comparison of plants with different size in air, we used the ratio between the PLA values of individual plants subjected to either submergence or waterlogging and the average PLA value of aerobic plants of the same genotype (PLA ratio).\nChlorophyll fluorescence measurement\n\n\nChlorophyll content was measured via spectroscopic absorbance of chlorophyll a and b, as previously described (\nYeung et al., 2018\n). Briefly chlorophyll was extracted from 3-week-old whole rosettes (nine-rosette leaf stage) using 96% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Approximately 100 mg of fresh leaf sample was ground in 96% DMSO and incubated at 65°C water bath for 4 h. After cooling, the supernatant was collected and absorbance at 664, 647, and 750 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer (Cary 50) in 1-mL cuvettes. Chlorophyll a and b concentrations, and total chlorophyll content were calculated following the equations of reference and were normalized to tissue fresh weight.\nRNA-seq transcriptomic analysis\n\n\nApproximately 100 mg of full rosettes from anoxia-treated or untreated plants were frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen, and were subjected to Trizol total RNA extraction. Total RNA samples were sent to BGI Genomics (BGI Americas Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA) for transcriptome sequencing on their DNBseq platform using 150-bp pair-end sequencing chemistry. Data processing and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis were also conducted by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Briefly, the reads obtained after sequencing were filtered to remove any low-quality, adapter-polluted, and high content of unknown base (N) reads. The clean reads thus obtained were mapped to the Arabidopsis reference genome (TAIR10_Araport11_\nwww.arabidopsis.org\n_20190423) using HISAT2 (\nKim et al., 2015\n). New transcripts were identified by StringTie (\nPertea et al., 2015\n), Cuffcompare (\nTrapnell et al., 2012\n), and CP5 (\nKong et al., 2007\n); and SNP and INDEl variants by GATK (\nMcKenna et al., 2010\n). Total clean reads were again mapped to reference using Bowtie2 (\nLangmead and Salzberg, 2012\n), and then calculated the gene expression level with RSEM (\nLi and Dewey, 2011\n). DEGs were detected with DEseq2, based on the negative binomial distribution (\nLove et al., 2014\n).\n\n\nLeaf tissue from 21-day-old plants were used for transcriptome analysis. RNA-seq data were obtained from three independent biological replicates for each of the conditions analyzed. On average, sequencing from the DNBseq platform generated 6.77 Gb bases per sample. All the samples had clean raw reads higher than 44 Mb. The average mapping ratio with the reference genome was 90.03% and the average mapping ratio was 78.29. Complete RNA-seq data have been deposited in the SRA database with the accession no. PRJNA666693.\nRNA extraction and RT–qPCR\n\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using trizol from 50-mg full rosette leaves. For RT–qPCR, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1-μg RNA using oligo dT18 primers (Invitrogen). RT–qPCR was performed on a Biorad CFX96 Real-Time PCR System (Biorad) with iTAQ SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad). Primers used are listed in \nSupplemental Table S27\n. Relative transcript abundance was calculated using the comparative 2\n−ΔΔCT\n method normalized to UBQ10 (\nCzechowski et al., 2005\n). The absence of a complete functional transcript in the mutants were confirmed by semi-quantitative PCR using the primers spanning either sides of T-DNA insertion (\nSupplemental Figure S15\n).\nMass spectrometry proteomic analysis\n\n\nArabidopsis whole rosette leaves were harvested from 2.5-week-old plants (six-rosette leaf stage) and proteins were extracted from leaves (\nBarkla et al., 2009\n). Protein identification was carried out at the Institute for Molecular Biosciences proteomics facility at the University of Queensland, Brisbane. Proteins were analyzed using an Eksigent, Ekspert nano LC400 uHPLC coupled to a TripleTOF 6600+ System (SCIEX, Canada) equipped with a PicoView nanoflow ion source (New Objective, USA). For protein isolation, 3 g of tissue were ground in liquid N2 and were then subjected to extraction using prechilled buffer containing: 100-mm Tris-MES, pH 8.0, 1-mm EGTA, 5-mm dithiothreitol, 4-mm MgSO\n4\n, 5% [w/v] insoluble POLYVINYLPYRROLIDONE (PVP), and plant protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) to the recommended concentration by manufacturer. The homogenate was then filtrated through Miracloth (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA), and subsequently clarified by centrifugation to remove cellular debris. The total proteins in supernatant (500 μL) were then precipitated using 200-μL 10X TE, 200 μL of 0.3% sodium deoxycholate, and 200 μL of cold 72% TCA. The protein pellets were washed in 90% methanol at room temperature and subsequently lyophilized.\n\n\nProteins were analyzed using an Eksigent, Ekspert nano LC400 uHPLC coupled to a TripleTOF 6600+ System (SCIEX, Canada) equipped with a PicoView nanoflow ion source (New Objective, USA). Protein extract (up to 5 μL) was injected onto a ChromXP C18-CL column (3 μm, 75 μm × 150 mm; SCIEX, Canada). Mobile phase solvents consisted of solvent A: 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Linear gradients of 5%–30% solvent B were run over 120 min at 400-nL min\n−1\n flow rate, followed by 30%–90% solvent B for 3 min, then 90% solvent B for 17 min, for peptide elution. The gradient was then returned to 5% solvent B for equilibration prior to the next sample injection. Column temperature was maintained at 45°C throughout. The ion spray voltage was set to 2,600 V, declustering potential at 80V, curtain gas flow 25 psi, nebulizer gas 30 psi, and interface heater at 150°C. The mass spectrometer was set to acquire 100 ms of full scan time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) data over the mass range 350–1,500 \nm/z\n, followed by up to fifty 50-ms full scan product ion data in IDA mode over the mass range 100–1,500 \nm/z\n. Ions observed in the TOF-MS scan exceeding a threshold of 100 counts and a charge state of +2 to +5 were set to trigger the acquisition of product ion tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra of the resultant 50 most intense ions.\nProtein identification and quantification\n\n\nProtein Pilot 5.0.2 (SCIEX, Canada) was used to search spectra against the Uniprot Arabidopsis database (129,652 proteins, 12 May 2020) and encode the output mzIdentML file for the downstream analysis. Scaffold 4.8.6 (Proteome Software, Portland, OR, USA) was used to validate MS/MS-based protein identifications and quantification. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at >99% probability and contained at least two unique peptides. NSAF was used for protein quantification (\nGulcicek et al., 2005\n; \nSearle, 2010\n).\nBioinformatics analysis for GO enrichment analysis\n\n\nProteins identified in at least two out of three biological replicates of leaf tissue from Col-0, \ncax1\n, and \ncax3\n post anoxia (8 h) were considered as present in the corresponding genotypes. To evaluate the significance of comparative quantification by different genotypes, Student’s \nt\n test was performed on the data, and the differences were assigned to be significant at a \nP\n <0.05. DAPs (including exclusively present proteins) were submitted to GO enrichment using ClusterProfiler package in R (\nWu et al., 2021\n).\nMalondialdehyde measurements\n\n\nMalondialdehyde (MDA) was quantified using a colorimetric method (\nStewart and Bewley, 1980\n). Briefly, full rosette leaves of 3-week-old plants (nine-rosette leaf stage) were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in 80% (v/v) ethanol. The supernatant was collected and mixed with a reactant mixture of 0.65% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid and 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532 nm with a spectrophotometer (Cary 50) in 1-mL cuvettes. To reduce the nonspecific absorption from other organic compounds, absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 600 nm and subtracted from the absorbance at 532 nm.\nIn situ staining of hydrogen peroxide and cell death in Arabidopsis leaves\n\n\nProduction of hydrogen peroxide in the cell was visualized by DAB staining and quantitated by measuring the oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H\n2\nDCFDA) (\nDaudi and O'Brien, 2012\n). Cell death was assayed by trypan blue staining (\nBhadauria et al., 2010\n).\nIn situ staining of hydrogen peroxide and cell death assays in Arabidopsis leaves\n\n\nDAB staining\n\n\nThe in situ staining of hydrogen peroxide in Arabidopsis leaves was performed following established protocols (\nDaudi and O'Brien, 2012\n). Whole rosettes from 3-week-old plants were stained with 1 mg/mL 3,3′-freshly prepared DAB dissolved in 20-mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n (pH 5.6) and 0.05% Tween-20. The leaves were stained at room temperature with shaking at 80–100 rpm under dark conditions for 6h. Following the incubation, the DAB staining solution was replaced with the destaining solution (80% ethanol) and incubated at 80°C for 15–20 min to remove the chlorophyll. This process was repeated until the chlorophyll was completely removed.\nH\n2\nDCFDA staining\n\n\nCellular levels of H\n2\nO\n2\n were studied by H\n2\nDCFDA staining (\nPedersen et al., 2017\n). The mature outer rosette leaves from 3-week-old plants were detached and stained with 10-µM H\n2\nDCFDA prepared in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min. After incubation, the leaves were washed twice with potassium phosphate buffer to remove the extra staining solution. The leaves were examined under a Leica TCS SPE Microscope (Model: DMi8 automated) using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, under 10× magnification.\nTrypan blue staining\n\n\nArabidopsis leaves were assayed for cell death using trypan blue (\nRawyler et al., 2002\n). Whole rosettes from 3-week-old plants were covered with lactophenol–trypan blue solution (10 mL of lactic acid, 10 mL of glycerol, 10 g of phenol, 10 mg of trypan blue, dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water). Leaves were stained at room temperature without vacuum infiltration in the solution for 1 h. Following incubation, the staining solution was replaced with 100% ethanol solution and incubated at room temperature overnight. The leaves were washed repeatedly in absolute ethanol until the green tissue became colorless. Leaves were then mounted onto glass microscopic slide with 60% glycerol (v/v) and were observed under Nikon SMZ1500 Microscope (WD136-Nikon). The blue precipitation indicating location of cell death was quantified using ImageJ software.\nReal-time measurements of cytosolic Ca in plant leaves post anoxia\n\n\nPlants were transformed with \np35S:GCaMP3\n using \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens\n GV3101 and floral dip according to (\nAtwell et al., 2015\n). Transformants were selected on hygromycin and T2 (or greater) lines used for analysis. Arabidopsis plants expressing the GFP-based Ca indicator GCaMP3 were imaged with a motorized fluorescence stereomicroscope (Zeiss Axio Zoom V16; Model, EMS3/SyCoP3) equipped with a PlanNeoFluar Z 1.0× objective lens and a Zeiss AxioCam HRm sCMOS camera. GCaMP3 was excited using a mercury lamp (with an intensity of 100% power of 150W Metal Halide Zeiss HXP 200c Illuminator), with a 470-/40-nm excitation filter, and a 500-nm dichroic mirror. The green fluorescent signal (Zeiss Filter Set 10 – GF) passing through a 535-/50-nm emission filter was acquired every 1 s for a total of 6 min with 210 Frames (360.55 s) using Zeiss Zen pro imaging software. Col-0 or \ncax1-1\n harboring the GCaMP3 sensor constructs were grown on half-strength MS media supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) sucrose. For experiments that monitored the onset of anoxia, plants were grown in small Petri dishes then placed in a plastic bag with 1 AnaeroPack (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The bag was modified to contain a glass-slide as a viewing window. Upon the onset of anoxia, the plant was immediately viewed through the window under the microscope as anoxic conditions formed within the bag. To minimize condensation, and not obstruct the imaging, a small ice pack was placed away from the plant inside prior to sealing the bag. Numerous no anoxia controls were performed (\nn\n > 20) to establish that the ice did not impact Ca signaling. Additionally, numerous (\nn\n > 30) experiments were performed for 30 min or more to establish that no signaling occurred after the initial Ca changes at the onset of anoxia. For post-anoxia measurements, the surgical tape around the plates was removed to allow air exchange in and out of the plates. The plates were then foil covered and placed in heat-sealed AnaeroPouch with one bag of AnaeroPack (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). GCamP3 fluorescence was measured to assay cytosolic Ca concentrations immediately after the plants were re-exposed to atmospheric oxygen. It took 15–30 s to reproducibly transfer the plants from the anoxic chamber to the microscope, precluding precise measurement during this initial period. Fluorescence was analyzed using ImageJ. Mean fluorescence intensity over time was then measured in the background and subtracted from the plant measurement. It is important to note that GCamP3 shows a very low signal under low Ca\n2+\n and then up to a six-fold increase when Ca\n2+\n levels rise. Therefore, the background represents a substantial proportion of the unstimulated signal (\nSupplemental Figure S16\n). Background was Col-0: 11.7 ± 3.4; cax1: 16.8 ± 5.7, mean ± \nsd\n. Experiments were run in duplicate each day and experiments repeated on different days over the course of multiple months until data from at least 10 replicates was recorded. See \nsupplementary data\n for full description.\nStatistical analysis\n\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post hoc testing or the Student’s \nt\n test formula in Microsoft Excel. Significance was set at \nP\n < 0.05. Data were presented as means ± \nsem\ns.\nAccession numbers\n\n\nSequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession number \nPRJNA666693\n. cax1-A (ABRC: CS25435), cax1-D (SALK_021486C), cax3 (ABRC: CS25429).",

The raw images acquired as previously described (\nVentura et al., 2020\n) and analyzed with LemnaGrid software (LemnaTec, GmbH, Aachen). The parameters measured were the projected leaf area (PLA, area of the rosette) and color (HUE) as described in \nVentura et al. (2020)\n.

    "trypan_blue_staining": "Arabidopsis leaves were assayed for cell death using trypan blue (\nRawyler et al., 2002\n). Whole rosettes from 3-week-old plants were covered with lactophenol–trypan blue solution (10 mL of lactic acid, 10 mL of glycerol, 10 g of phenol, 10 mg of trypan blue, dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water). Leaves were stained at room temperature without vacuum infiltration in the solution for 1 h. Following incubation, the staining solution was replaced with 100% ethanol solution and incubated at room temperature overnight. The leaves were washed repeatedly in absolute ethanol until the green tissue became colorless. Leaves were then mounted onto glass microscopic slide with 60% glycerol (v/v) and were observed under Nikon SMZ1500 Microscope (WD136-Nikon). The blue precipitation indicating location of cell death was quantified using ImageJ software.",
    "real-time_measurements_of_cytosolic_ca_in_plant_leaves_post_": "Plants were transformed with \np35S:GCaMP3\n using \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens\n GV3101 and floral dip according to (\nAtwell et al., 2015\n). Transformants were selected on hygromycin and T2 (or greater) lines used for analysis. Arabidopsis plants expressing the GFP-based Ca indicator GCaMP3 were imaged with a motorized fluorescence stereomicroscope (Zeiss Axio Zoom V16; Model, EMS3/SyCoP3) equipped with a PlanNeoFluar Z 1.0× objective lens and a Zeiss AxioCam HRm sCMOS camera. GCaMP3 was excited using a mercury lamp (with an intensity of 100% power of 150W Metal Halide Zeiss HXP 200c Illuminator), with a 470-/40-nm excitation filter, and a 500-nm dichroic mirror. The green fluorescent signal (Zeiss Filter Set 10 – GF) passing through a 535-/50-nm emission filter was acquired every 1 s for a total of 6 min with 210 Frames (360.55 s) using Zeiss Zen pro imaging software. Col-0 or \ncax1-1\n harboring the GCaMP3 sensor constructs were grown on half-strength MS media supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) sucrose. For experiments that monitored the onset of anoxia, plants were grown in small Petri dishes then placed in a plastic bag with 1 AnaeroPack (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The bag was modified to contain a glass-slide as a viewing window. Upon the onset of anoxia, the plant was immediately viewed through the window under the microscope as anoxic conditions formed within the bag. To minimize condensation, and not obstruct the imaging, a small ice pack was placed away from the plant inside prior to sealing the bag. Numerous no anoxia controls were performed (\nn\n > 20) to establish that the ice did not impact Ca signaling. Additionally, numerous (\nn\n > 30) experiments were performed for 30 min or more to establish that no signaling occurred after the initial Ca changes at the onset of anoxia. For post-anoxia measurements, the surgical tape around the plates was removed to allow air exchange in and out of the plates. The plates were then foil covered and placed in heat-sealed AnaeroPouch with one bag of AnaeroPack (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). GCamP3 fluorescence was measured to assay cytosolic Ca concentrations immediately after the plants were re-exposed to atmospheric oxygen. It took 15–30 s to reproducibly transfer the plants from the anoxic chamber to the microscope, precluding precise measurement during this initial period. Fluorescence was analyzed using ImageJ. Mean fluorescence intensity over time was then measured in the background and subtracted from the plant measurement. It is important to note that GCamP3 shows a very low signal under low Ca\n2+\n and then up to a six-fold increase when Ca\n2+\n levels rise. Therefore, the background represents a substantial proportion of the unstimulated signal (\nSupplemental Figure S16\n). Background was Col-0: 11.7 ± 3.4; cax1: 16.8 ± 5.7, mean ± \nsd\n. Experiments were run in duplicate each day and experiments repeated on different days over the course of multiple months until data from at least 10 replicates was recorded.
