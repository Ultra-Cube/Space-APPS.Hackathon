Although\nCOVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more\nthan 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the\nimmune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nHerein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil\nα-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated\ngraphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta\nvariant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta\nvariant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding\nwith host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Using the\nmodified Hill equation, we have determined \nn\n = 2.6\nand the effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with\nthe ACE2–spike protein binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha,\nbeta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, experimental data shows that the\nbinding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those\nfor the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human\nACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability\nfor completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions\ninto host cells via blocking the ACE2–spike protein binding.\nExperimental data shows that the inhibition efficiency for LL-37 peptide-\nand HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than that of only one\ntype of peptide-attached GQDs.",
    "introduction": "1\nIntroduction\nThe\ncurrent global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for over 5.4 million\ndeath till now.\n1\n−\n4\n It is now well understood that during COVID-19 infection, the spike\nprotein S1 unit containing the receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) facilitates\nthe virus attachment to humans by binding to the angiotensin converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the nasal epithelial mucosal cells, which\nis the key path for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells.\n5\n−\n9\n Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein became the target for COVID-19\nvaccines available in the market, which can generate neutralizing\nantibodies against the S-RBD upon immunization.\n9\n−\n14\n The emergence of double mutant delta (B.1.617.2) variants, which\ncontain the L452R and T478K mutations on the S-RBD, has enhanced the\nbinding affinity with ACE2.\n1\n−\n6\n Recent reports also indicate that mutations on the S-RBD lead to\na prominent decline in neutralizing antibody levels against the delta\nvariant by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination.\n7\n−\n12\n Due to the above fact, designing a new strategy to block the spike\nprotein–ACE interaction is very important for preventing mutate\nvariant infection.\nAlthough the mortality rate is very high\nfor COVID-19, reported\ndata also indicates that around 42% of infected individuals are asymptomatic\ncarriers, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively controlled\nby the human’s innate immune system.\n1\n−\n9\n α-Defensin human neutrophil peptides (HNP1, HNP2, HNP3, and\nHNP4) and human β-defensins (HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3) as well as\nLL-37 (leucine-leucine-37) cathelicidin family peptides are members\nof the innate immune system.\n11\n,\n15\n−\n17\n Defensins and cathelicidin peptides play a crucial role in the human\nbody for viral inhibition via binding and destabilizing.\n11\n,\n15\n−\n17\n Driven by the need to block the delta variant infection,\nherein we report the design of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene\nquantum dots (GQDs), which have the capability to bind to the SARS-CoV-2\ndelta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD and block the S-RBD interaction\nwith ACE2, which prevents the virus entry into the host cells, as\nshown in \nFigure \n1\n.\nFigure 1\n(A) Scheme\nshowing the design of HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense\npeptide-conjugated GQDs and binding of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated\nGQDs in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike\nprotein RBD. (B) Scheme showing the blocking of the S-RBD interaction\nwith ACE2 on a human cell membrane and preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus\nentry.\nGraphene quantum dots (GQDs) consisting\nof a graphene lattice and\ncontaining single or few sheets of graphene fragments exhibit size-dependent\nluminescence properties originating from the quantum confinement effects\nand edge effects.\n18\n−\n23\n GQDs containing different surface groups such as carboxy, epoxy,\nand hydroxyl exhibit a high water solubility, high surface area, excellent\nphotostability, and biocompatibility.\n18\n−\n23\n Due to their unique optical and other properties, GQDs became a\nvery good choice for use in bioimaging, biosensing, and other biotechnology\napplications.\n18\n−\n23\n In our design, bioconjugated GQD fluorescence has been used to monitor\nthe SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD–host\ncells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction to\ndetermine the effective binding affinity. Also, the functional groups\non the surface and edge of GQDs have been used for the inactivation\nof the virus via decomposition of the lipid membrane of the virus\nand for the removal of spike proteins that are attached on the lipid\nmembrane.",

The first absorption peak is observed\nat ∼270 nm, which can be due to the π–π*\ntransition, and the second peak is at ∼306 nm, which can be\ndue to the n−π* transition.\n18\n−\n23\nFigure S2F\n and \nFigure \n2\nC show the luminescence spectra of peptide-attached\nGQDs at 360 nm excitation, where the strong emission maximum at 416\nnm can be due to the electron–hole recombination and quantum\nsize effect.\n18\n−\n23\nFigure \n2\nB shows that\npeptide-attached GQDs exhibit a strong blue fluorescence under UV\nlight. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was determined to\nbe ∼0.28 for peptide-attached GQDs. The photoluminescence decay\nprofiles for peptide-attached GQDs are reported in \nFigure \n2\nD, which fit very well with\nthe triple exponential function with τ\n1\n = 0.32 ns,\nτ\n2\n = 2.2 ns, and τ\n3\n = 7.3 ns.\n3.2\nDetermining the Biocompatibility and Cytotoxicity\nTo determine the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the LL-37\nand HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, we used normal skin HaCaT cells, lung\ncancer A549 cells, and human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high\nexpression of ACE2 (HEK-293T).\n11\n−\n15\n,\n26\n,\n27\n All cells were treated with 60 μg/mL GQDs + 4 μg/mL\nLL-37 + 4 μg/mL HNP1 for 48 h.\n11\n−\n15\n,\n26\n,\n27\n As reported in \nFigures S3A,B\n in the Supporting\nInformation, after treatment with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs or only GQDs or only peptides, the cell viability was hardly\nchanged for all the cell lines. The reported experimental data clearly\nindicate that the LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs do not exhibit\nany detectable cytotoxicity after 48 h of treatment.\n3.3\nDetermining the Binding Affinity between the\nSARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and\nLL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs\nNext, we have\ndetermined whether the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike\nprotein RBD can bind with HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached\nGQDs, which is a very important parameter for the inhibition of virus\ninfection. The experimental details are reported in the \nSupporting Information\n. The luminescence signals\nfrom GQDs in the presence and absence of the spike protein were recorded\nwith a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser.\n11\n−\n15\n,\n26\n,\n27\n The reported photograph in \nFigure \n2\nB also shows that the intense fluorescence from peptide-conjugated\nGQDs decreases in the presence of the spike protein.\nIn the\ncase of peptide-attached GQDs, the graphene quantum dots can bind\nwith the spike protein via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding,\nand charge transfer interaction.\n18\n,\n19\n On the other\nhand, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides can bind with the spike protein via\nhydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and hydrophobic interaction.\n11\n,\n12\n,\n15\n The observed huge fluorescence\nquenching clearly indicates the strong interaction between peptide-attached\nGQDs and the spike protein. The reported fluorescence quenching can\nbe the result of the static quenching due to the formation of a nonfluorescent\ncomplex in the ground state. On the other hand, the observed quenching\ncan be due to the dynamic quenching, which is based on the Förster\nresonance energy transfer from the donor peptide-attached GQDs to\nthe acceptor spike protein. As reported in \nFigure \n2\nD, the photoluminescence decay curve remains\nalmost the same in the presence or absence of the delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein, which indicates that the fluorescence lifetime (τ\n1\n = 0.30 ns, τ\n2\n = 2.2 ns, and τ\n3\n = 7.1 ns) in the presence of the spike protein is very similar\nto the data in the absence of the protein. The experimental lifetime\ndata clearly indicates that the observed quenching is a static quenching\nprocess.\nSimilarly, as reported in \nFigure S1E\n in the Supporting Information, the UV–vis absorption\nmaximum\nfrom peptide-attached GQDs is ∼10 nm shifted to a higher wavelength\nin the presence of the spike protein, which also indicates the formation\nof a complex in the ground state between the peptide-attached GQDs\nand spike protein. Often, the static quenching process can be described\nby the Stern–Volmer equation\n20\n,\n22\n,\n24\n,\n25\n as described below\n1\n2\nwhere \nF\n0\n is the fluorescence intensity\nfrom the peptide-conjugated\nGQDs in the absence of the spike protein, \nF\n is the\nfluorescence intensity in the presence of the spike protein, and [spike]\nis the protein concentration. \nK\nSV\n is the\nStern–Volmer constant, which depends on quencher rate coefficients\n(\nK\nq\n) and the lifetime τ\n0\n of the GQDs’ excited state in the absence of spike.

The observed\nhigher binding affinity of GQDs conjugated with both the peptides\n(HNP and LL-37) than GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide\ncan be due to the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike\nprotein in the case of two peptide-attached GQDs.

(H) Bright-field image of HEK-293T\ncells in the presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 & HNP1\nhuman host defense peptide-attached GQDs.\nAs reported in \nFigure \n3\nB,C, the TEM images indicate that peptide-conjugated GQDs\nare bound on the virus. Since the binding affinity for LL-37 peptide-\nand HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than only HNP1-attached\nGQDs, we observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on the\nvirus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After that, to determine\nwhether HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability\nto prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking\nthe spike protein RBD–ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic\nkidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T). For this\nexperiment, we have used GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a\nSARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number\n#C1123G). The experimental details are reported in the \nSupporting Information\n.\n26\n,\n27\n As shown in \nFigure \n3\nD, in the absence of peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta\nvariant virus binds with ACE2 on HEK-293T cells. The observed green\nfluorescence is due to the presence of GFP-tagged pseudotyped virus\nparticles on the surface of HEK-293T cells via binding with ACE2. \nFigure \n3\nE shows the bright-field\nimage of HEK-293T cells, which indicates the presence of the pseudotyped\nvirus on the cell surface. As shown in \nFigure \n3\nH, in the presence of LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus cannot bind with ACE2 on\nHEK-293 T cells, and as a result, we have not observed any green fluorescence.\nSince LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have high binding affinity\nwith the delta variant spike protein, the data shown above indicates\nthat they can be used to completely block the binding between ACE2\nand the spike protein. Due to the above fact, LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta\nvariant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells. On the other hand,\nas reported in \nFigures \n3\nF,G, LL-37 peptide-attached GQDs and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs cannot\ncompletely block the virus spike protein–ACE2 binding. As reported\nin \nFigure \n4\nB, the blocking\ncapability decreases from 100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used.\nAlso, the blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding\naffinity, as reported in \nTable \n1\n.\nFigure 4\n(A) Interaction of Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta\nvariant (B.1.617.2) spike protein and ACE2 on HEK-293T cells, measured\nusing fluorescence imaging.

On the other hand, less than the 10% inhibition\nwas achieved when only GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used.\nThe\nreported data in \nTable \n3\n and \nFigure \n4\nB also\nindicate that 70% inhibition can be achieved when LL-37 (4 μg/mL)\npeptide-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. Similarly, using\nonly the LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide, we have achieved 40% inhibition.\nFrom the reported inhibition data, we can conclude that the inhibition\nefficiencies for LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs are much higher than\nonly one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptide or GQDs. To\nunderstand better about the above experimental observation, we have\nalso performed TEM and SEM imaging experiments after LL-37 and HNP1-attached\nGQDs are exposed to the virus for 12 h. The SEM image in \nFigure \n4\nC and the TEM image\nin \nFigure \n4\nD clearly\nshow that LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs can destroy the lipid membrane\nof Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein.

Due to the above fact, LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta\nvariant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells. On the other hand,\nas reported in \nFigures \n3\nF,G, LL-37 peptide-attached GQDs and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs cannot\ncompletely block the virus spike protein–ACE2 binding. As reported\nin \nFigure \n4\nB, the blocking\ncapability decreases from 100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used.\nAlso, the blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding\naffinity, as reported in \nTable \n1\n.\nFigure 4\n(A) Interaction of Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta\nvariant (B.1.617.2) spike protein and ACE2 on HEK-293T cells, measured\nusing fluorescence imaging.

The experimental details are reported in\nthe \nSupporting Information\n.\n13\n,\n14\n,\n26\n,\n27\nFigure \n4\nB shows the\n% inhibition, which clearly shows that 100% inhibition was achieved\nin the case of LL-37 (4 μg/mL) and HNP1 (4 μg/mL)-attached\nGQDs (30 μg/mL). On the other hand, less than the 10% inhibition\nwas achieved when only GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used.\nThe\nreported data in \nTable \n3\n and \nFigure \n4\nB also\nindicate that 70% inhibition can be achieved when LL-37 (4 μg/mL)\npeptide-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. Similarly, using\nonly the LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide, we have achieved 40% inhibition.\nFrom the reported inhibition data, we can conclude that the inhibition\nefficiencies for LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs are much higher than\nonly one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptide or GQDs. To\nunderstand better about the above experimental observation, we have\nalso performed TEM and SEM imaging experiments after LL-37 and HNP1-attached\nGQDs are exposed to the virus for 12 h. The SEM image in \nFigure \n4\nC and the TEM image\nin \nFigure \n4\nD clearly\nshow that LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs can destroy the lipid membrane\nof Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein. Due to the above fact, the delta variant virus collapses\nand spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane are removed.\nThe above process helps to stop the spread of the delta variant virus.\nTable 3\nHalf-Maximal Inhibitory Concentration\n(IC50) for the Peptide-Conjugated GQDs, Only Peptide, and GQDs Using\nHEK293T Cells Expressing the ACE2 Receptor\nsystem\nIC\n50\nLL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs\n30 μg/mL\nGQDs + 2 μg/mL LL-37 + 2 μg/mL HNP1\nLL-37-attached GQDs\n30 μg/mL\nGQDs + 3 μg/mL LL-37\nHNP1-attached\nGQDs\n30 μg/mL GQDs + 11 μg/mL HNP1\nLL-37 peptide\n4.5 μg/mL\nHNP1 peptide\n13.8 μg/mL",
    "conclusions": "4\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, in the current article, we show that HNP1 and LL-37\npeptide-conjugated GQDs can be used to prevent the delta variant virus\nentry into the host cells by blocking spike protein RBD binding with\nACE2. We have demonstrated that peptide-attached GQD-based fluorescence\nquenching can be used for determining the binding affinity of the\ndelta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. The reported experimental\ndata show that the effective binding affinity between the HNP1 and\nLL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs and delta variant spike protein is comparable\nwith the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity. Using the alpha,\nbeta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, we have shown that the binding\naffinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for\nother variants. Our experimental observation using the HEK293T-human\nACE2 cell line demonstrated that LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-conjugated\nGQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta\nvariant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells and the inhibition\nefficiency for two peptide-attached GQDs is much higher than those\nfor only one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptides or GQDs.",
