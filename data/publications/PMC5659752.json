    "summary": "The evolutionary success of parasitoid wasps, a highly diverse group of\ninsects widely used in biocontrol, depends on a variety of life history\nstrategies in conflict with those of their hosts [\n1\n]. \nDrosophila melanogaster\n\nis a natural host of parasitic wasps of the genus \nLeptopilina\n.\nAttack by \nL. boulardi\n (\nLb\n), a specialist wasp\nto flies of the melanogaster group, activates NF-κB-mediated humoral and\ncellular immunity. Inflammatory blood cells mobilize and encapsulate\n\nLb\n eggs and embryos [\n2\n–\n5\n].\n\nL. heterotoma\n (\nLh\n), a generalist wasp,\nkills larval blood cells and actively suppresses immune responses. Spiked\nvirus-like particles (VLPs) in wasp venom have clearly been linked to its\nsuccessful parasitism of \nDrosophila\n [\n6\n], but VLP composition and their biotic\nnature have remained mysterious. Our proteomics studies reveal that VLPs lack\nviral coat proteins but possess a pharmacopoeia of (a) eukaryotic vesicular\ntransport system, (b) immunity, and (c) previously unknown proteins. These novel\nproteins distinguish \nLh\n from \nLb\n VLPs; notably,\nsome proteins specific to \nLh\n VLPs possess sequence similarities\nwith bacterial secretion system proteins. Structure-informed analyses of an\nabundant \nLh\n VLP surface/spike-tip protein, p40, reveal\nsimilarities to the needle-tip invasin proteins SipD/IpaD of Gram negative\nbacterial type 3 secretion systems that breach immune barriers and deliver\nvirulence factors into mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that\n\nLh\n VLPs represent a new class of extracellular organelles\nand share pathways for protein delivery with both eukaryotic microvesicles and\nbacterial surface secretion systems. Given their mixed prokaryotic/eukaryotic\nproperties, we propose the term Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs) to\nreplace VLP.\nKeywords:\n Drosophila, immune suppression, hemocytes, parasitoid wasps, venom, virus-like particles, secretion systems, T3 secretion system, proteomics, mixed strategy extracellular vesicles",
    "results": "Sister \nLeptopilina\n species produce different VLPs\n\n\nLarvae of parasitic wasps of the \nLeptopilina\n genus feed\non \nDrosophila\n larval host tissues, and eclose into free-living\nadults (\nFig 1 A\n). The VLP-producing\ngeneralist/specialist \nL. heterotoma\n\n(\nLh\n)/\nL. boulardi\n (\nLb\n)\nwasps differ greatly in their infection of their natural host \nD.\nmelanogaster\n, as seen in the anterior lobes of the fly larval lymph\nglands. Hematopoietic progenitors are housed in the gland’s medulla\n(marked by \nDome-Meso-GFP\n) and mature hemocytes, in the cortex\n(GFP-negative, \nFig 1 B\n).\n\nLb\n 17 infection induces lamellocyte differentiation (\nFig 1 C\n), while \nLh\n 14 attack\ncauses cell loss in both the medulla and the cortex, and few cells survive\n(\nFig 1 D\n). The differences in the\nvirulence of \nLh\n versus \nLb\n is attributed to\ndifferences in the VLPs produced by these wasps [\n7\n] and the mechanism of\n\nLh\n-induced cell killing are not understood. VLPs from\n\nLb\n 17 and \nLh\n 14 differ in morphology;\n\nLb\n 17 VLPs have fewer spikes and are somewhat larger than\n\nLh\n VLPs (\nFig 1 E, F\n)\n[\n8\n]. A peripheral\nmembrane lipid bilayer (~ 10 nm) surrounds \nLh\n VLPs,\nwhich lack the typical coat-like structure found in some viruses (\nFig 1 G\n). Because of their key role in wasp parasitism\nof \nDrosophila\n spp. [\n4\n, \n5\n], we hypothesized\nthat differences in the composition of spiked particles produced in the venom of\nboth wasps underlie these contrasting infection strategies.\n\n\nFig 1.

Peptide sequences from each VLP proteome\n(\nLh\n 14 and \nLh\n NY wasps) were first aligned\nagainst RNA-Seq \nLh\n 14 transcripts [\n10\n], translated to open reading frames\n(ORFs). We thus obtained a common set of \nLh\n VLP proteins\n(present in both proteomes; \nTables S1\n, \nS2\n) and verified these VLP protein sequences at >\n90% identity against two \nLh\n expressed sequence tags\n(ESTs; ~ 30 proteins or 20% [\n11\n] and ~ 70 proteins or 45%\n[\n12\n] of the common\nproteome). To identify candidate pathogenicity effectors, we compared the common\n\nLh\n VLP dataset to abdominal transcripts of\n\nLb\n 17 and a distantly-related species \nGanaspis\nsp.1\n (G1) that lacks spiked VLPs [\n10\n, \n11\n, \n13\n] (\nFig 2\n). A summary of our major findings follows.\n\n\nFig 2.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nLh\n VLP proteome\n​\n\n\nLh\n VLP proteins are arranged by known/predicted functions and\nannotations. Key provided in center of figure. \n(Layer 1, outer most\nlayer)\n Signal peptide predictions are most commonly found in the\ncategories of virulence, immunity, and novel proteins. \n(Layer 2)\n GO\n(gene ontology) terms for conserved cell biology proteins are abundant.\n\n(Layers 3, 4)\n The cytoskeletal/fibronectin proteins and the\nmajority of novel sequences lack similarity to abdominal transcripts from both\n\n(Layer 3)\n\n\nLb\n 17 or \n(Layer 4)\n\n\nG1\n female wasps. \n(See also\n\n\nTables S1\n, \nS2\n; \nData S1,\nS2\n.\n)\nLh\n VLPs are rich in eukaryotic microvesicular\nproteins\n\n\nNo proteins with significant homology to structural proteins of any known\nvirus, including polydnaviruses (PDVs) associated with ichneumonid and braconid\nwasps, which prey on Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera [\n14\n], were found in the\n\nLh\n proteome. The 161 proteins common to \nLh\n\n14 and \nLh\n NY VLP proteomes were categorized as (1) conserved\neukaryotic proteins with core biological function (42%, Class 1); (2)\nvirulence/immunity-associated proteins (24%, Class 2); or (3) novel\nsequences (34%, Class 3) (\nFigs 2\n,\n\n3 A\n). Of the ~ 160 VLP\nproteins, 25% are \nLh\n-specific (i.e., they are not\nexpressed by \nLb\n 17 [\n10\n]) and most (27/41, 66%) of these proteins are\nnovel (Class 3) (\nFig 2\n). Class 1 sequences\ncontain orthologs of \nDrosophila\n and mammalian extra- and\nintracellular vesicle (including microvesicle and exosome) components as well as\nmembrane proteins (\nFig 3 A – C\n).\nThe presence of transmembrane (e.g., Na/K pump, SERCA calcium pump) and vesicle\ntransport proteins (e.g., H\n+\n-ATPase, heat shock cognate 70,\nRab proteins, and soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) (\nFigs 2\n, \n3 A –\nC\n) in the proteome suggest that \nLh\n VLPs are not\nviral but instead share functional properties with eukaryotic extracellular\norganelles called microvesicles, produced by animals cells, and specialized to\ntransfer proteins between different cell types [\n15\n].\n\n\nFig 3. \nLh\n VLPs are enriched in microvesicular/exosomal and\nmembrane-associated proteins.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\n(A)\n Select example \nLh\n VLP proteins, many of which\nare expected to be membrane-associated via integral or other biochemical\nmechanisms, are displayed by their proteomic Classes 1 – 3 (bulleted\nwithin descriptive subclasses). Example subclasses and individual proteins found\nin enrichment analyses \n(B, C)\n are shown in red. AGT =\nanterograde transport; RGT = retrograde transport. \n(B, C)\n\nEnrichments from Vesiclepedia: The organelle character of \nLh\n\nVLPs based on GO Terms of predicted orthologs is \n(B)\n significant\nand \n(C)\n highly enriched. \n(B)\n Among VLP proteins with\nannotated orthologs, 71% are mitochondrial, of which 12% are\nlocalized to the mitochondrial inner membrane. Approximately 50% of\nconserved sequences in the proteome are common to microvesicles/exosomes.\n\n(C)\n Vesicular and mitochondrial, including that of the caspase\ncomplex, terms are the most over-represented. Furthermore, genes within the GO\nTerm (GO:0008303) for pro-apoptotic caspase complexes were more than 200 times\nover-represented. \n(See also\n\n\nTables S1\n, \nS2\n.\n)\nDiverse pathogenicity mechanisms are housed in VLPs\n\n\nCandidate immune-modulating (Class 2) VLP proteins include two\ndiedel-like proteins with high similarities to sequences from insect viruses (60\nand 62% similarity to \nNP_059254.1\n, \nXestia c-nigrum\ngranulovirus\n; \nFig 2\n; \nData S1\n). Interestingly,\na \nDrosophila\n diedel modulates the IMD/NF-κB-dependent\nantimicrobial cascade [\n16\n] and the VLP diedel proteins may similarly suppress host\nsignaling. An \nLh\n VLP enhancin-like protein shows similarity to\n\nYersinia\n spp. enhancins (42% similarity to\n\nWP_012413443.1\n, \nYersinia pseudotuberculosis\n; \nFig 2\n; \nData S1\n), although enhancins are also found in insect\nviruses [\n17\n]. Additional\nClass 2 immunity and development proteins include: (1) imaginal disc growth\nfactor 4-like sequence (Idgf4) (83% similarity to \nXP_008560038.1\n,\n\nMicroplitis demolitor\n); (2) fire ant\n(\nSolenopsis\n)-derived venom allergen (62% similarity\nto \nXP_008560038.1\n, \nNasonia vitripennis\n); and (3) B-cell\nreceptor-associated protein 31 (89% similarity to \nXP_008554920.1\n,\n\nMicroplitis demolitor\n) (\nFig\n2\n; \nData S1\n).\nTwo VLP proteins may protect and regulate parasite development: an\nantimicrobial/antifungal-like knottin protein (46% similarity to\n\nXP_014233229.1\n, \nTrichogramma pretiosum\n) and a predicted\nhemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein (56% similarity to\n\nABV82429.1\n, \nDrosophila melanogaster\n) (\nFig 2\n; \nData S1\n) [\n11\n].\n\n\nIn the Class 2 set, we also identified two families of invertebrate\nimmunity proteins (\nFigs 2\n, \n3 A\n). At least 6 \nLh\n RhoGAPs were\nfound that, like \nLb\n GAP of \nLb\n [\n18\n], may inhibit parasite\nencapsulation. A group of 14 metalloendopeptidases (MEPs) were also identified\nin the proteome and, although they are structurally similar to proteins from\ndiverse kingdoms, their virulence functions may be similar to those of MEPs from\nparasitic wasps \nVenturia canescens\n [\n19\n] and \nNasonia vitripennis\n\n[\n20\n]. The diversity\nof predicted activities of Class 2 proteins likely facilitates\n\nLh\n success across a broad range of\n\nDrosophila\n spp.\n\n\nThe abundance of novel proteins in Class 3 of the proteome was\nintriguing. Domain identifications predict viral domains (Pox L5 (PF04872),\nBaculo_PEP_C (PF04513.10), and Baculo_11_kDa (PF06143.9)) in three VLP sequences\n[\n21\n, \n22\n]. One of these, Baculo_11_kDa VLP sequence\nalso shows similarity to phage tail tape measure proteins (data not shown). In\naddition to the multiple gene families in \nLh\n VLPs that are\ncommon to \nLb\n and \nG1\n (e.g., RhoGAPs and MEPs;\n\nFigs 2\n, \n3\nA\n), \nLh\n-specific gene families include fibronectin\ndomain-containing sequences and a new family of GTPases (\nFigs 2\n, \n3 A\n;\n\nData S2\n). Multiple\nmembers of gene families are expressed in wasp venoms [\n23\n–\n25\n], and identification of the gene families in\n\nLh\n VLPs suggests that gene duplications and\nneofunctionalization underlie the powerful virulence strategy of\n\nLh\n.\nNovel endomembrane-active GTPases\n\n\nBecause the novel GTPase peptides are of high abundance in the\n\nLh\n VLP proteomes and are absent from the\n\nLb\n abdominal transcriptome, we investigated their predicted\nstructures and functions in detail. All of the three small (SmGTPase) and five\nlarge GTPase (LgGTPase) sequences have N-terminal signals for secretion as well\nas key residues for GTP hydrolysis (\nFig 4 A\n– C\n; \nData\nS2\n). Five of the 8 (small and large) GTPase family members possess\nprokaryotic domains present in eubacterial and/or archaeal (e.g., PF09488, \nFig 4 A, A′\n) proteins. Beyond a few\nproteins from parasitic wasps (\nN. vitripennis\n, G1, and\n\nL. clavipes\n), the closest putative homologs of these\nGTPases are prokaryotic (\nFig 4 B\n; \nData S2\n).\n\n\nFig 4.

Four predicted active site G motifs are\nlabeled below the conserved consensus residues (black boxes) in the MSA.

Close\nalignment of the predicted SmGTPase01 active site with the active site structure\nof HRas, the canonical small GTPase, supports the domain analyses results (\nFig 4 A, A′, & C\n). The large\nGTPases are predicted to fold into C-terminal coiled-coils (\nFig 4 A′\n). These findings suggest a curious\nblend of prokaryotic and eukaryotic properties within this new family of\n\nLh\n VLP proteins, which likely have GTPase enzymatic\nactivity and are likely secreted from wasp cells for incorporation into\nvesicles.\nT3SS-like VLP proteins: Similarities between VLP p40 and bacterial\nSipD/IpaD\n\n\nProkaryotic protein motifs were identified in nearly 10% of\nnovel Class 3 sequences. Overlapping protein motifs,\n[\nBacillus\n PF05103; fungal PF15577]\nassociated with cell division and microtubule binding, respectively, were\nidentified in a single Class 3 protein. KEGG Mapper BlastKAOLA identified (a)\nSyd-like (SecY-interacting, Type 2 secretion systems) and (b) flgE-like\n(bacterial flagellar hook) proteins with low-to-mid scores. A sopE-like\n(bacterial GEF toxin) protein was also found. The presence of bacterial\nsecretion system and flagellar proteins is especially interesting as these\nmacromolecular assemblies are structurally and functionally related and the Type\n3 secretion system (T3SS) of the self-assembling bacterial flagella are thought\nto be ancestral to the ones found in the needle/injectisome of pathogens\n[\n26\n].\n\n\nOur previous antibody staining and inhibition studies uncovered an\nabundant 40 kDa surface protein of \nLh\n VLPs\n(“p40”) which is necessary for lamellocyte lysis [\n9\n]. Early in VLP biogenesis, p40 is\nassociated with the membranes of canals that emanate from the cytoplasm of\nsecretory cells of the venom gland, where it is synthesized. Once in the canal\nlumen, p40 is then associated with membranous vesicles that are released from\nsecretory cells. The vesicles mature into spiked VLPs which carry p40 both on\ntheir surfaces and spikes [\n9\n,\n\n27\n]. The bacterial T3SS\ndomain from IpaD/SipD/BipD (\nPRK15330\n, E = 7.60\n−05\n)\nproteins was found in residues 39-146 of p40 (\nFig\n4 D\n). This assignment was made by peptide mapping, cloning and\nexpressing polyhistidine-tagged p40 in bacteria. In western blot experiments,\nanti-p40 antibody recognized this bacterially-expressed protein (\nFig S1 A\n). As expected,\np40 is detected in wasp venom extracts (\nFig S1 B\n). We were unable to identify a putative\n\nLb\n 17 or G1 p40 ortholog (\nFig\n2\n) and, to our knowledge, p40 represents the first eukaryotic protein\nwith an IpaD/SipD-like domain.\n\n\nIpaD-like proteins from\n\nShigella/Salmonella/Burkholderia\n spp. are tip proteins of\nT3SS injectisomes, mediating contact and regulated delivery of effectors into\nthe host cytoplasm of non-phagocytic cells [\n28\n]. IpaD expression in mammalian macrophages\ntriggers apoptosis [\n29\n],\nreminiscent of the TUNEL-positive death of fly macrophages upon\n\nLh\n infection [\n7\n]. Unlike the bacterial proteins, p40 is predicted to\nencode a C-terminal transmembrane helix in addition to an N-terminal secretion\nsignal (\nFigs 4 D\n; \nS1 C\n). p40’s\ntransmembrane domain (this study) and its extracellular localization in venom\ngland canals [\n27\n] suggest\nthat p40 exits venom gland secretory cells in association with microvesicle-like\nstructures. This interpretation is in agreement with the extracellular vesicular\nproteomic profile of VLPs (\nFig 3\n).\n\n\nGiven the unexpected parallels in their structures and surface/tip\nlocalizations, we hypothesized that, like IpaD/SipD on the T3SS injectisome, p40\non VLP spikes facilitates invasive contact with the plasma membrane of\nnon-phagocytic lamellocytes to deliver VLP contents. To test this idea, we\ncarried out \nab initio\n modeling of p40. The knowledge-based\nenergetics of the p40 model are similar to crystal structures of similar length\n(ProSA Z-Score = −6.23). 82% of model residues are found\nin expected local environments (3D Verify). Superimposition of the p40 model\nagainst IpaD confirmed the T3SS protein-like fold in p40 (\nFigs 4 E\n; \nS1 C\n) [\n30\n].\n\n\nSurprisingly, high-scoring matches to this fold included the vertebrate\nactin-binding proteins spectrin and plectin (\nFig 4\nF\n, superimposed with p40), further strengthening structural parallels\nbetween p40 and IpaD/SipD. Searches for the most similar structures within the\nN-terminal half of IpaD family proteins also returned actin-binding proteins\n(talin, vinculin, α-catenin) [\n31\n]. These proteins are known to reprogram the actin\ncytoskeleton leading to the profuse membrane ruffling observed in non-phagocytic\nmammalian cell invasions by \nSalmonella\n and\n\nShigella\n [\n31\n].",

A sopE-like\n(bacterial GEF toxin) protein was also found. The presence of bacterial\nsecretion system and flagellar proteins is especially interesting as these\nmacromolecular assemblies are structurally and functionally related and the Type\n3 secretion system (T3SS) of the self-assembling bacterial flagella are thought\nto be ancestral to the ones found in the needle/injectisome of pathogens\n[\n26\n].\nOur previous antibody staining and inhibition studies uncovered an\nabundant 40 kDa surface protein of \nLh\n VLPs\n(“p40”) which is necessary for lamellocyte lysis [\n9\n]. Early in VLP biogenesis, p40 is\nassociated with the membranes of canals that emanate from the cytoplasm of\nsecretory cells of the venom gland, where it is synthesized. Once in the canal\nlumen, p40 is then associated with membranous vesicles that are released from\nsecretory cells. The vesicles mature into spiked VLPs which carry p40 both on\ntheir surfaces and spikes [\n9\n,\n\n27\n]. The bacterial T3SS\ndomain from IpaD/SipD/BipD (\nPRK15330\n, E = 7.60\n−05\n)\nproteins was found in residues 39-146 of p40 (\nFig\n4 D\n). This assignment was made by peptide mapping, cloning and\nexpressing polyhistidine-tagged p40 in bacteria. In western blot experiments,\nanti-p40 antibody recognized this bacterially-expressed protein (\nFig S1 A\n). As expected,\np40 is detected in wasp venom extracts (\nFig S1 B\n). We were unable to identify a putative\n\nLb\n 17 or G1 p40 ortholog (\nFig\n2\n) and, to our knowledge, p40 represents the first eukaryotic protein\nwith an IpaD/SipD-like domain.\nIpaD-like proteins from\n\nShigella/Salmonella/Burkholderia\n spp. are tip proteins of\nT3SS injectisomes, mediating contact and regulated delivery of effectors into\nthe host cytoplasm of non-phagocytic cells [\n28\n]. IpaD expression in mammalian macrophages\ntriggers apoptosis [\n29\n],\nreminiscent of the TUNEL-positive death of fly macrophages upon\n\nLh\n infection [\n7\n]. Unlike the bacterial proteins, p40 is predicted to\nencode a C-terminal transmembrane helix in addition to an N-terminal secretion\nsignal (\nFigs 4 D\n; \nS1 C\n). p40’s\ntransmembrane domain (this study) and its extracellular localization in venom\ngland canals [\n27\n] suggest\nthat p40 exits venom gland secretory cells in association with microvesicle-like\nstructures. This interpretation is in agreement with the extracellular vesicular\nproteomic profile of VLPs (\nFig 3\n).\nGiven the unexpected parallels in their structures and surface/tip\nlocalizations, we hypothesized that, like IpaD/SipD on the T3SS injectisome, p40\non VLP spikes facilitates invasive contact with the plasma membrane of\nnon-phagocytic lamellocytes to deliver VLP contents. To test this idea, we\ncarried out \nab initio\n modeling of p40. The knowledge-based\nenergetics of the p40 model are similar to crystal structures of similar length\n(ProSA Z-Score = −6.23). 82% of model residues are found\nin expected local environments (3D Verify). Superimposition of the p40 model\nagainst IpaD confirmed the T3SS protein-like fold in p40 (\nFigs 4 E\n; \nS1 C\n) [\n30\n].\nSurprisingly, high-scoring matches to this fold included the vertebrate\nactin-binding proteins spectrin and plectin (\nFig 4\nF\n, superimposed with p40), further strengthening structural parallels\nbetween p40 and IpaD/SipD. Searches for the most similar structures within the\nN-terminal half of IpaD family proteins also returned actin-binding proteins\n(talin, vinculin, α-catenin) [\n31\n]. These proteins are known to reprogram the actin\ncytoskeleton leading to the profuse membrane ruffling observed in non-phagocytic\nmammalian cell invasions by \nSalmonella\n and\n\nShigella\n [\n31\n].",
    "discussion": "The composition of \nLh\n VLPs is complex and interesting in\nmultiple respects but the most conspicuous observations are an absence of viral\nstructural proteins and the presence of conserved eukaryotic proteins with\nmicrovesicular signature. Abundant \nLh\n-unique proteins, including\ncurrently novel proteins, have an unexpected diversity of domains, especially those\npreviously found exclusively in prokaryotic proteins. The mechanisms that\ncontributed to the evolution of VLP proteins (horizontal gene transfer or others\n[\n32\n]) remain unknown.\nLh\n VLPs lack the defined symmetry and external coat found\nin many true viruses including PDVs. Reminiscent of eukaryotic organelles,\nprecursors and mature VLPs exhibit heterogeneity in their shapes, sizes, and spike\nnumbers [\n9\n, \n33\n]. Moreover, it is noteworthy that, unlike PDVs\nwhich are fully formed in the cells of their origin and then released by lysis or\nbudding [\n14\n],\n\nLeptopilina\n VLPs assume their final shape outside the cells in\nwhich at least some of their proteins and vesicular constituents are synthesized\n[\n9\n, \n27\n]. Also, there is currently no evidence for the\npresence of nucleic acids in VLPs, which further distinguishes them from\nDNA-containing PDVs.\nVLPs are unlike endosymbiotic bacteria of \nLeptopilina\n wasps\n[\n34\n].\nAntibiotic-treatment of \nL. victoriae\n (sister species of\n\nLh\n that make VLPs and carry\ncytoplasmic-incompatibility-inducing \nWolbachia\n) did not affect\ngenomic amplification of p40 or SmGTPase01 genes. Furthermore, VLP gene loci were\namplified not only from female \nLh\n 14 genomes but also male wasp\ngenomes, even though VLPs are not produced in males. BrdU incorporation studies did\nnot support the possibility of DNA-based VLP replication in the venom gland (our\nunpublished results). The non-replicating nature of the particles, genomic encoding\nof VLP protein genes, and vesicular signature of their proteome strongly suggest\nthat \nLh\n VLPs are neither viruses nor endosymbiotic bacteria but\ninstead represent a new class of genomically-encoded, microvesicle-like organelles.\nExtracellular vesicles are produced by prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and VLPs\ncarry a diversity of potential immune-suppressive proteins. We, thus, propose the\nalternative moniker, MSEV (Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles), to replace the\nVLP term.\nVirulence factors of parasitic wasps have diversified in response to the\nvariety and complexities of their hosts’ immune systems. With a broad host\nrange [\n3\n], \nLh\n\nwasps parasitize many \nDrosophila\n spp. whose own distinct immune\nresponses are supported by varying numbers and types of blood cells [\n35\n]. This may explain, first, the\ndiversity of putative virulence and cell death proteins with homologs across the\nbiological kingdoms [viral (diedel), bacterial (p40, Syd-like), and\neukaryotic (fire ant allergen, B-cell receptor-associated protein 31,\netc.)], and second, the presence of MSEV paralogs\n[\nLh\n-specific GTPase and \nLh-/Lb\n-common\nRho GAP, MEPs, and diedel gene families] in the proteome. Multiple members\npresumably perform redundant or overlapping cell-specific functions for rapid and\nrobust immune suppression, much like the IκB/Cactus-like ankyrin-repeat\nproteins of distantly-related bracoviral and ichnoviral PDV proteins that block\nNF-κB signaling [\n36\n, \n37\n].\nThe parallels between the 3D-structure and locations of p40 with the\nwell-characterized T3SS IpaD-like prokaryotic proteins are provocative and suggest\nthat p40 likely contributes to \nLh\n MSEVs’ unique blood\ncell-killing activities. T3SS assemblies are widespread and are used by bacteria to\ninfect plants and animals [\n26\n]. \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n use their own T3SS to\nrapidly infect and kill adult flies. While cytotoxic to macrophages, \nP.\naeruginosa\n infection activates the NF-κB-dependent IMD\nantimicrobial pathway [\n38\n].\nIt is thus possible that elements of the pathogenic bacterial systems have been\nco-opted by wasps to attack the fly’s cellular immune system. In this\nscenario, intracellular protein complexes within lamellocytes would be under direct\nselective pressure to respond to MSEV-based T3SS-like virulence.\nThe presence of prokaryotic-like (particularly, T3SS/flagellar-like)\nproteins, hints at the possibility that either MSEV spikes evolved from primordial\nflagellar/needle-like structures or they share evolutionary history with such\nstructures. These findings also support a hypothesis proposed by Martin and\ncolleagues [\n39\n] that the\neukaryotic endomembrane system may have arisen from bacterial outer membrane\nvesicles. In this regard, characterization of the prokaryotic protein motifs that\ncomprise nearly 10% of the novel proteins outlined above will be especially\nrevealing. The molecular mechanisms by which MSEV proteins deplete and destroy its\nwell-characterized hosts’ immune system will suggest how virulence factors\nare acquired by insect parasites, how these factors evolve, and how insects might\nserve as reservoirs of disease. Answering these questions is likely to lead to new\ncost-effective therapies for treating emerging infections and opportunistic\ndiseases.",
    "star_methods": "CONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARING\n\n\nFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be\ndirected to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Shubha Govind\n(\nsgovind@ccny.cuny.edu\n).\nEXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS\n\n\nFly strains\n\n\nAll fly stocks were healthy and free of common laboratory\ninfections. Genetically stable stocks with the desired, uniform genotypes\nwere used for infections and crosses were not necessary. The \ny\nw\n strain of \nD. melanogaster\n (used as wild\ntype) and \nDome-MESO-GFP\n (gift from M. Crozatier\n[\n41\n]) (see \nKey Resource Table\n(KRT)\n) were used. \nDome-MESO\n-GFP is a synthetic\nconstruct that replaces \nlacZ\n with GFP expression in\nP{dome-lacZ.MESO} (Fly Base FBtp0022619) and produces GFP marked regions of\n\ndomeless\n (the fly JAK/STAT receptor) expression\n[\n41\n]. Flies were\nraised on standard fly food [cornmeal (65 g/L), sucrose (140 g/L),\nagar (10 g/L), and yeast (35 g/L) with tegosept made in 95% ethanol\n(22.6 ml/L) and propionic acid (5 ml/L)] (see \nKRT\n) medium and\nmaintained long term at 18°C with inspection and flipping to new\nvials every three to four weeks. Prior to experimental work, fly stocks were\nmoved to fresh food, shifted to 25°C, and maintained for at least\ntwo generations. Adults were used for 2 to 3 rounds of egglays to produce\nlarvae for wasp infections. Mid to late second instar larvae (both male and\nfemale) were used for infections and sacrificed during dissection.\n\n\nLeptopilina\n spp. parasitoid wasp strains\n\n\nAll wasp stocks were healthy and free of common laboratory\ninfections. The following wild type parasitoid wasp species and strains were\nused: \nLeptopilina heterotoma\n 14 (\nLh\n 14)\n[\n3\n], \nL.\nheterotoma\n NY (\nLh\n NY) [\n9\n], \nL. victoriae\n\n(\nLv\n) [\n33\n], and \nL. boulardi\n 17\n(\nLb\n 17) [\n3\n]. (A detailed genotypic notation system has not been\nformalized for \nLeptopilina\n spp. as mutant or transgenic\nwasps have not been produced to date.) \nLh\n (strains 14 and\nNY) and \nL. victoriae\n are sister species with VLPs that are\nindistinguishable from each other [\n9\n]. Wasp stocks were maintained at 18°C\nlong-term via infestation of healthy and infection-free mid to late second\ninstar \ny w D. melanogaster\n larvae raised on the same fly\nfood medium as the “fly-alone” cultures (see Fly Strain\ndetails, above, for husbandry and housing of flies). Adult wasps were moved\nto 25°C prior to experimental infections. Free-living, adult female\nwasps were collected with males at approximately one week post eclosion\n(PE). Mated females were used in experimental infections and were used for\ninfections only once. For VLP purification, female wasps were sorted from\nmales for dissection of venom gland apparatus (males do not possess venom\nglands).\nBacteria\n\n\nE. coli\n BL21 cells (see \nKRT\n for genotype)\nwere used for expression of the p40 central domain (CD).\nMETHOD DETAILS\n\n\nWasp infections, dissections, and imaging\n\n\nFor experimental infections, cultures containing both male and\nfemale mid to late second instar \nD. melanogaster\n larvae\nwere exposed to 10 – 12 mated, 1 week PE, \nLh\n 14 or\n\nLb\n 17 female wasps [\n3\n] for 12 hours at 25°C. Wasps\nwere removed and larvae were allowed to recover in the medium for 5 hours at\n25°C. Infected larvae were scooped from the medium, scored for age,\nmatched to \ny w\n control wasp-infected larvae, washed in\ndeionized water, washed in phosphate buffered saline (1X PBS, pH 7.2,\n25°C), and dissected to obtain larval lymph gland tissue. Infection\nwas validated during dissection by the presence of wasp eggs (free floating\nor attached onto larval gut tissue) and uninfected hosts were discarded.\n\n\nDissections and slide preparations were performed at 25°C.\nTissue was dissected on untreated glass slides by bleeding larvae and\npulling the cuticle bilaterally below the mouth hooks to leave the mouth\nparts, lymph gland, and dorsal vessel. After air drying, excess tissue was\nremoved. Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed,\npermeabilized (1X PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100), and washed again in\n1X PBS. Counterstains were applied (Rhodamine-tagged Phalloidin at 0.5 mg/ml\nand Hoechst 33258 at 0.02 mg/mL) and samples were washed and then mounted in\nVectaShield.\n\n\nSamples were imaged with a Zeiss 510 confocal at 40X. Laser settings\nwere based on GFP negative and uninfected control tissue and all images were\nscanned using the same instrument settings. Images were processed with Zeiss\nLSM image browser. Figures were compiled in Adobe Photoshop v12.0.4 and CC\n2015.5 and Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n\nResults shown in \nFig 1\n were\nvalidated in dissections of at least twenty animals (n = 20 lymph\nglands) each, infected by either wasp. Results have also been validated by\ninfections and dissection of at least three other \nD.\nmelanogaster\n genotypes with replicates of at least five animals\n(n = 5 lymph glands). All infection-related changes to lymph gland\nmorphologies were included in our conclusions (no data were excluded). No\nstrategies for randomization and/or stratification, blinding, or sample-size\nestimation were utilized, or found to be necessary, for this study.\nVLP purification\n\n\nThree hundred each \nLh\n 14 [\n3\n] and \nLh\n NY\n[\n9\n] female wasps\n(see Wasp Strain section, above, for husbandry and housing details) of 1 to\n2 weeks PE were sacrificed by submerging in 70% ethanol and rinsed\nat least three times each in deionized water and 0.1X PBS (pH 7.2) at\n4°C. Venom gland complexes were dissected in PBS by grasping the\novipositor and gently pulling. Only intact, dissected venom gland complexes\nwith a VLP long gland, reservoir, and ovipositor were used in the\npurification protocol; other body parts were discarded. Tissue was collected\nin 1X PBS (4°C), gently crushed with a sterile pestle in\n200μL of 1X PBS (4°C), shook vigorously in 300 μL 1X\nPBS (4°C), pulse agitated, and added to the top of a 4°C\nNycodenz gradient. The gradient of 50 to 10% Nycodenz in 1X PBS (5\nbands of 900 μL, each) was prepared in a clean, RNA-free Beckman 9\ncm centrifuge tube and pre-chilled. Whole VLPs were separated from other\ntissues into a single band by ultracentrifugation (20,000 RPM, 7°C,\n80 mins). The VLP band was removed from the gradient, washed with 1X PBS\n(4°C), pelleted (11,700 RPM, 7°C, 35 mins), resuspended in a\nminimum of 1X PBS (4°C), and stored (4°C). Extraction of\nVLPs from ~ 300 long gland complexes has consistently yielded\nupwards of thousands of VLPs.\nElectron microscopy\n\n\nFor cryo electron microscopy (EM), purified VLPs were pipetted onto\na holey carbon coated grid. Excess fluid was blotted (Whatman #1)\nand the grid was plunge frozen (liquid ethane) and stored in liquid\nnitrogen. Samples were visualized with a Technai G2 (200kV) at the New York\nStructural Biology Center. Membrane surrounding \nLh\n VLPs\n(observed via cryo EM in \nFig 1\n) was\npresent in all VLPs of more than two sample preparations and this result\nconfirmed previously-published findings from transmission electron\nmicroscopy experiments [\n6\n,\n\n9\n].\n\n\nFor scanning EM (SEM), purified VLPs (washed and re-suspended, PBS)\nwere fixed in glutaraldehyde (3% in 0.085M sodium cacodylate buffer,\novernight, 4°C), followed by cacodylate buffer (0.085M, 1 hr,\n4°C). After washing (glass distilled water) and fixing in osmium\ntetroxide (1% in 0.085M cacodylate buffer, 1 hr, 4°C), VLPs\nwere filtered onto polycarbonate membranes (0.1 μm pores). Filtered\nsamples were then dehydrated in serial ethanol washes (technical grade, to\n70%) and stored overnight. The membranes were washed (amyl acetate),\ndried, and mounted on pin stubs. Membranes were gold-palladium plated and\nstored at 60°C until imaged on a Ziess Supra 55 SEM. Parameters for\nSEM imaging of \nLh\n, \nLv\n, and\n\nLb\n VLPs were consistent for all samples and technical\nreplicates; data presented are representative of many particles from at\nleast two replicates per species’ VLP.\nMS/MS analysis of \nLh\n VLP proteins\n\n\nPurified VLPs were separated on a 1-D SDS-PAGE gel as per standard\nprotocols. Bands were excised, destained, reduced, alkylated, and trypsin\ndigested. Peptides from combined additional lanes (L457) were also analyzed.\nPeptides were extracted (Applied Biosystems POROS 20 R2 beads), cleaned-up\n(C18 ZipTips), dried, and reconstituted in 2%\nacetonitrile/0.1% formic acid. \nLh\n 14 peptides were\ntrapped (Waters Symmetry® C\n18\n trap column (180 μm\n× 100 mm, 5 μm particles)), washed, and separated on a\nWaters BEH130 C\n18\n column (1.7 μm particle size) (Waters\nNanoAcquity UPLC (Milford, MA)). \nLh\n NY peptides were\nseparated on a Waters BEH130 C\n18\n column (75 μm ×\n150 mm). The MS analysis was performed on an LTQ-Orbitrap (ThermoFisher,\nCA).\n\n\nThe instrument RAW files were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer\n(PD) 1.4.0.288 with a work template that contained a Target Decoy PSM\nValidator node (peptide spectrum matches) with both Sequest and Mascot\nalgorithms. Mascot searches, independent of PD, were also conducted. Peptide\nmass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, and the fragment mass tolerance was 0.6\nDa. The enzyme was set to “trypsin” with two maximum missed\ncleavage sites and the search was against VLPSwiss_20140319.fasta (1332969\nentries). Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed\nmodification. Deamidation of asparagine and glutamine and oxidation of\nhistidine, methionine and tryptophan were specified as variable\nmodifications. Methylation at aspartic acid residues was specified only for\nMascot analyses conducted without PD. The .msf output files were integrated\ninto Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.7.3, Proteome Software Inc.) which was\nused to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications.\nIdentification of \nLh\n VLP proteins\n\n\nVLP proteins (\nTables S1\n, \nS2\n) reported here had at least two proteomic peptides,\nidentified at 99% or greater probability by either PD or solo Mascot\nsearches, that aligned to a target sequence. In addition, four proteins are\nincluded in the list where only one peptide aligned at 99% more\nprobability (see below, Protein sequence annotations subsection).\nFull-length target protein sequences were translated from RNA-Seq\n\nLh\n 14 (\nGAJC00000000.1\n) transcripts translated to ORFs\n[\n10\n].\n\n\nThe number of aligned peptides varied slightly between PD and Mascot\nanalyses conducted without PD. The PD results have been deposited to the\nProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE [\n42\n] partner repository (see \nKRT\n for link).\n\n\nIn this report, VLP composition is based on the subset of proteins\ncommon to both the \nLh\n 14 and NY strains. The common,\nfull-length VLP protein ORFs (\nTables S1\n, \nS2\n) were annotated via \n(A)\n primary\nsequence analyses, and \n(B)\n structure-based analyses and\npredictions for select proteins (described below). Note that the\n\nLh\n 14 dataset is larger and select \nLh\n\n14-unique sequences were preferentially included.\nAdditional verification of protein sequences\n\n\nThe VLP peptides were also searched against other proteomes (Uniprot\n\nD. melanogaster\n, \nA. mellifera\n,\n\nH. sapiens\n, viral, prokaryotic and archaea databases\n[\n43\n]). The\nfull-length proteins identified from the RNA-Seq ORFs [\n10\n] were BLASTed against\n\nLh\n ESTs (NCBI LIBEST 028179 and 028205, [\n11\n, \n12\n]), providing an alternative method of ORF sequence\nverification. This step also identified the full, or near full, length VLP\nprotein clones in our \nLh\n EST collection (e.g.,\n\nLh\n VLP Sm & LgGTPas01). Roughly 20% and\n~ 45% of the common VLP proteins were identified in the\nHeavner et al. 2013 [\n11\n] and the Colinet et al. 2013 [\n12\n] studies. (See below, for methods of\nidentification of absence/presence of expression of each \nLh\n\nVLP protein in \nLb\n 17 and G1 abdominal transcriptomes (\nFig 2\n).)\nProtein sequence annotations\n\n\nThe automated, pipe-line annotation algorithms of (1) BLAST2GO, E\n<= 10\n−5\n (v2.7.0) [\n44\n], (2) InterProScan (v5.3–46)\n[\n45\n], and (3)\nFastAnnotator [\n46\n]\nwere used to characterize all (common set) VLP proteins identified from VLP\npeptide alignments to \nLh\n transcriptome ORFs (See above).\nMultiple bioinformatic methods were used to avoid algorithm bias and\nincrease accuracy. Two related criteria were used as measures of reliability\nof annotations: (a) E values (E <= 10\n−5\n);\nand (b) percent identity and percent similarity (applied only when at least\n75% of the query aligned to the hit).\n\n\nFor manual annotations, BLASTs were conducted via NCBI\n[\n47\n] (nr and TSA\ndatabases, default parameters [\n48\n]). To identify potential \nLh\n VLP\nprotein homologs in microbiota, the unannotated full-length VLP proteins\nwere pBLAST searched against a subset of all nr archaea, viruses, and\nprokaryotic genomes at higher sensitivity (GenBank, E <=\n10). To identify \nLh\n VLP proteins expressed by\n\nLb\n 17 and \nG1\n, all VLP sequences were\ntBLASTn searched with default parameters against \nGAJA00000000.1\n (Lb 17) and\n\nGAIW00000000.1\n transcriptomes (\nGanaspis sp1\n\n(\nG1\n)) [\n10\n]. The Conserved Domains Database (CDD) [\n49\n, \n50\n] and PFAM [\n51\n] were used for domain identifications and\narchitectures. Manual annotation results are reported in main text only if\nthey were confirmed by a second method. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) Orthology (KO) numbers were assigned using GhostKOALA\n[\n52\n]. KO numbers\nwere then used to obtain model ortholog annotations.\n\n\nFor pairwise and multiple-sequence alignments, T-Coffee\n[\n53\n], Needleman\n[\n54\n],\nClustalOmega [\n55\n],\nand MUSCLE [\n56\n, \n57\n] (EBI webserver, default\nparameters) were used and ESPript 3.0 [\n58\n] was used for visualizations. FunRich\n[\n59\n] was used for\nfunctional enrichment and over-representation analyses against two\nextracellular vesicle databases, Exocarta [\n60\n, \n61\n] and Vesiclepedia [\n62\n]. Circos (v0.69) was used to visualize\nthe proteome [\n63\n].\n\n\nThe four proteins with only on a single aligned peptide (99%\nor greater peptide probability) (\nFig 3\n;\n\nTables S1\n,\n\nS2\n) passed the\n(1) manual inspections of their MS/MS spectra and fragments, (2) solo Mascot\nsearches, and (3) Exocarta/Vesiclepedia enrichment analyses. Of these four\nproteins, one is classified as novel (Class 3; \nFigs 2\n, \n3 A\n), while the\nother three have sequence similarities with eukaryotic proteins (Class 1;\n\nFig 2\n, \n3\n) of extracellular vesicles (\nFig 3 B, C\n).\n\n\nIn silico\n structural predictions of SmGTPase01\n\n\nA high-quality structural model was created for SmGTPase01 using a\nhybrid approach. A MODELLER [\n64\n] model was created using three templates: GIMAP\ncrystal structure 3V70 and two \nab initio\n models\n[\n65\n]. 3V70 was\nchosen using threading metaservers (LOMETS [\n66\n] and PHYRE2 [\n67\n]) and was evaluated in single-template\nMODELLER trials. Loop modeling and side-chain optimization were done using\nLoopy [\n68\n] and SCWRL4\n[\n69\n],\nrespectively. The active site of this full-length model is presented in\n\nFig 4 C\n; the remaining details of\nthe model will be published elsewhere.\n\n\nThe SmGTPase01 co-factor, Mg2+, was placed in the active\nsite based on COFACTOR [\n70\n] and was checked for positioning using WHAT IF\n[\n71\n]. GTP was\nplaced and checked for energy minimization in the SmGTPase01 active site\nwith Autodock Vina [\n72\n]. The cofactor and substrate placements were confirmed\nwith predictions from COACH [\n73\n], BSP-SLIM [\n74\n], and 3D Ligand [\n75\n].\n\n\nThe qualities and knowledge-based energy values of our models were\nassessed using ProSA-web [\n76\n] and Verify3D [\n77\n]. TM-Align was used to compare crystal structures and\nour \nin silico\n models [\n30\n]. STRIDE [\n78\n] was used to define secondary\nstructures from molecular coordinates. Crystal structure molecular files\ncame from the Protein Data Bank (\nhttp://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do\n).\nCloning and structural predictions of p40\n\n\nFor p40-specific proteomics, peptides isolated and digested from an\nanti-p40 positive SDS-PAGE gel band were sequenced at the Harvard\nMicrochemistry Facility by HPLC-MS/MS (Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap) and\nthen BLAST queried against NCBI \nGAJC00000000.1\n RNA-Seq \nLh\n\n14 database.\n\n\nFor p40 cloning and expression, the p40 IpaD-like central domain\n(CD) was amplified from venom gland cDNA and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO. Primer\nsequences are listed in \nKey Resource Table\n. The p40 central domain (amino acids 26\n– 240, \nFig 4 D\n) was expressed\nfrom a pTrcHisA subclone by addition of IPTG (1 mM, ThermoFisher\nScientific). \nE. coli\n BL21cells were lysed by freeze-thaw in\nlysis buffer (10% triton X, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris\nHCl, pH 6.8) with protease inhibitors (AEBSF-HCl 100 mM, aprotinin 80\nμM, bestatin 5 mM, E-64 1.5 mM, leupeptin 2 mM, pepstatin A 1 mM,\nSigma or Fermentas). Protein concentrations in all assays were determined\nwith Bradford reagent [\n79\n].\n\n\nFor the verification of p40 identity via western analyses, bacterial\nproteins were separated (SDS-PAGE, 5% stacking and 12%\nresolving), transferred to membrane (nitrocellulose, HyBond, Amersham Life\nScience), and blocked (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1 % Tween 20, 5%\nnonfat dry milk, 3% bovine serum albumin (1 hr, 25°C)).\nPrimary antibodies used were anti-p40 (1:1000) or anti-6X-His (1:1000; 12\nhr, 4°C). Alkaline-phosphatase-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody\n(1:2,500; 1 hour, 25°C), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolyphosphate\n(BCIP, Amresco), and nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT, Biotium) solutions in\nNaCl-Tris-MgCl\n2\n buffer (NTM, pH 9.5) were used for\ndetection.\n\n\nFor p40 structural predictions, \nab initio\n and\ntemplate fragment assembly methods [\n80\n] [\n65\n] were used along with N-terminal predictions from\nMODELLER’s loop methods [\n81\n–\n83\n].\nStructural optimizations were generated using ModRefiner [\n84\n]. The most N- and C-terminal\nresidues of p40 are predicted to be a signal peptide and transmembrane helix\nand were not modeled (\nFig\nS1 C\n). Crystal structures (\nhttp://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do\n) similar to our\n\nin silico\n p40 model were identified using DaliLITE\n[\n85\n].\nAntibiotic treatment of \nLv\n\n\n\n\nTo cure \nLv\n adults of the strain of Gram negative\n\nWolbachia\n endosymbionts [\n34\n], three successive generations of\n\nLv\n females were cultivated from infections of \ny\nw D. melanogaster\n egglays on fly food medium containing\nrifampicin at 0.75 mg/g (see Fly and Wasp Strain sections, above, for\nhusbandry and housing details). The next six generations of\n\nLv\n wasps were cultivated on larvae raised on standard,\nantibiotic-free medium, to assure no direct drug effects. Isogenized control\nwasps did not receive antibiotic treatment and were otherwise reared the\nsame way as experimental wasps. For PCR amplification of wasp genomic DNA,\nantibiotic-treated and control male and female wasps, no more than 1 week\nPE, were sorted into microfuge tubes and frozen at −20°C.\nGenomic DNA template was amplified for the absence or presence of (a)\n\nLv\n-specific \ngatB\n and\n\ncoxA\n genes of \nWolbachia\n, and (b) VLP\nprotein genes (p40 and Sm/LgGTPase01) (see Analyses of genomic sequences,\nbelow, and \nKRT\n).\nResults from all PCR amplification experiments supported the conclusions in\nthis study.\nAnalyses of genomic sequences\n\n\nTotal genomic DNA from \nLh\n, antibiotic-treated\n\nLv\n, and control wasps was obtained using a Qiagen DNA\nBlood and Tissue kit. Primer sequences are listed in \nKRT\n; the following\nnotation is used: \n\n\ny\n = pyrimidines; \nr\n\n= purines; and \nk\n = T and G.\nQUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\n\nDetails regarding experimental replicates are provided with each Method.\nAs indicated in the Wasp infections, dissections, and imaging subsection, n in\nthis study refers to the whole lymph gland of an animal (i.e., two lobes). More\nthan 35 lymph glands from larvae of different genotypes yielded consistent\nresults after wasp infection. Similarly, examination of numerous VLPs in each\nsample, as well as repetition of different EM protocols provided \nsupporting information\n\nregarding VLP morphologies. Confidence in proteomics results is based on peptide\ncharacterizations of purified VLP preparations from two independent strains of\n\nLh\n. The criteria of agreement between multiple, independent\nmethods for identification and annotation of VLP proteins (both novel and\npreviously characterized) were met. Confidence in quantitative bioinformatics\nresults (e.g., E values for BLAST results and domain predictions, RMSDs for\nprotein model analyses, p-values for enrichments) is based on the algorithms\nintrinsic to these methods and is described in the corresponding primary\nreferences. Where possible, more than one computational approach (supported by\ndifferent algorithms and metaservers) was used to strengthen interpretation by\navoiding biases arising from a single computational methodology. No additional\nstatistical analyses or methods to determine assumption credibility and/or\nsample size were conducted for this study.\nDATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY\n\n\n.mzid files for all VLP protein gel bands for both \nL.\nheterotoma\n 14 and NY (see MS/MS analysis of \nLh\n VLP\nproteins methodology, above) were exported from Scaffold and submitted to PRIDE,\na ProteomeXchange repository member (see \nKRT\n for links). .mzid files provide the data for VLP\npeptide identification in the mzIdentML proteomics format (\nTables S1\n, \nS2\n), a HUPO Proteomics\nStandards Initiative (Proteomics Informatics Standards group) standard.",

Infected larvae were scooped from the medium, scored for age,\nmatched to \ny w\n control wasp-infected larvae, washed in\ndeionized water, washed in phosphate buffered saline (1X PBS, pH 7.2,\n25°C), and dissected to obtain larval lymph gland tissue. Infection\nwas validated during dissection by the presence of wasp eggs (free floating\nor attached onto larval gut tissue) and uninfected hosts were discarded.\n\n\nDissections and slide preparations were performed at 25°C.\nTissue was dissected on untreated glass slides by bleeding larvae and\npulling the cuticle bilaterally below the mouth hooks to leave the mouth\nparts, lymph gland, and dorsal vessel. After air drying, excess tissue was\nremoved. Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed,\npermeabilized (1X PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100), and washed again in\n1X PBS.

Laser settings\nwere based on GFP negative and uninfected control tissue and all images were\nscanned using the same instrument settings. Images were processed with Zeiss\nLSM image browser. Figures were compiled in Adobe Photoshop v12.0.4 and CC\n2015.5 and Illustrator CC 2015.\n\n\nResults shown in \nFig 1\n were\nvalidated in dissections of at least twenty animals (n = 20 lymph\nglands) each, infected by either wasp. Results have also been validated by\ninfections and dissection of at least three other \nD.\nmelanogaster\n genotypes with replicates of at least five animals\n(n = 5 lymph glands). All infection-related changes to lymph gland\nmorphologies were included in our conclusions (no data were excluded). No\nstrategies for randomization and/or stratification, blinding, or sample-size\nestimation were utilized, or found to be necessary, for this study.\nVLP purification\n\n\nThree hundred each \nLh\n 14 [\n3\n] and \nLh\n NY\n[\n9\n] female wasps\n(see Wasp Strain section, above, for husbandry and housing details) of 1 to\n2 weeks PE were sacrificed by submerging in 70% ethanol and rinsed\nat least three times each in deionized water and 0.1X PBS (pH 7.2) at\n4°C. Venom gland complexes were dissected in PBS by grasping the\novipositor and gently pulling. Only intact, dissected venom gland complexes\nwith a VLP long gland, reservoir, and ovipositor were used in the\npurification protocol; other body parts were discarded. Tissue was collected\nin 1X PBS (4°C), gently crushed with a sterile pestle in\n200μL of 1X PBS (4°C), shook vigorously in 300 μL 1X\nPBS (4°C), pulse agitated, and added to the top of a 4°C\nNycodenz gradient. The gradient of 50 to 10% Nycodenz in 1X PBS (5\nbands of 900 μL, each) was prepared in a clean, RNA-free Beckman 9\ncm centrifuge tube and pre-chilled. Whole VLPs were separated from other\ntissues into a single band by ultracentrifugation (20,000 RPM, 7°C,\n80 mins). The VLP band was removed from the gradient, washed with 1X PBS\n(4°C), pelleted (11,700 RPM, 7°C, 35 mins), resuspended in a\nminimum of 1X PBS (4°C), and stored (4°C). Extraction of\nVLPs from ~ 300 long gland complexes has consistently yielded\nupwards of thousands of VLPs.\nElectron microscopy\n\n\nFor cryo electron microscopy (EM), purified VLPs were pipetted onto\na holey carbon coated grid. Excess fluid was blotted (Whatman #1)\nand the grid was plunge frozen (liquid ethane) and stored in liquid\nnitrogen. Samples were visualized with a Technai G2 (200kV) at the New York\nStructural Biology Center. Membrane surrounding \nLh\n VLPs\n(observed via cryo EM in \nFig 1\n) was\npresent in all VLPs of more than two sample preparations and this result\nconfirmed previously-published findings from transmission electron\nmicroscopy experiments [\n6\n,\n\n9\n].\n\n\nFor scanning EM (SEM), purified VLPs (washed and re-suspended, PBS)\nwere fixed in glutaraldehyde (3% in 0.085M sodium cacodylate buffer,\novernight, 4°C), followed by cacodylate buffer (0.085M, 1 hr,\n4°C). After washing (glass distilled water) and fixing in osmium\ntetroxide (1% in 0.085M cacodylate buffer, 1 hr, 4°C), VLPs\nwere filtered onto polycarbonate membranes (0.1 μm pores). Filtered\nsamples were then dehydrated in serial ethanol washes (technical grade, to\n70%) and stored overnight. The membranes were washed (amyl acetate),\ndried, and mounted on pin stubs. Membranes were gold-palladium plated and\nstored at 60°C until imaged on a Ziess Supra 55 SEM. Parameters for\nSEM imaging of \nLh\n, \nLv\n, and\n\nLb\n VLPs were consistent for all samples and technical\nreplicates; data presented are representative of many particles from at\nleast two replicates per species’ VLP.\nMS/MS analysis of \nLh\n VLP proteins\n\n\nPurified VLPs were separated on a 1-D SDS-PAGE gel as per standard\nprotocols. Bands were excised, destained, reduced, alkylated, and trypsin\ndigested. Peptides from combined additional lanes (L457) were also analyzed.\nPeptides were extracted (Applied Biosystems POROS 20 R2 beads), cleaned-up\n(C18 ZipTips), dried, and reconstituted in 2%\nacetonitrile/0.1% formic acid. \nLh\n 14 peptides were\ntrapped (Waters Symmetry® C\n18\n trap column (180 μm\n× 100 mm, 5 μm particles)), washed, and separated on a\nWaters BEH130 C\n18\n column (1.7 μm particle size) (Waters\nNanoAcquity UPLC (Milford, MA)). \nLh\n NY peptides were\nseparated on a Waters BEH130 C\n18\n column (75 μm ×\n150 mm). The MS analysis was performed on an LTQ-Orbitrap (ThermoFisher,\nCA).\n\n\nThe instrument RAW files were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer\n(PD) 1.4.0.288 with a work template that contained a Target Decoy PSM\nValidator node (peptide spectrum matches) with both Sequest and Mascot\nalgorithms. Mascot searches, independent of PD, were also conducted. Peptide\nmass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, and the fragment mass tolerance was 0.6\nDa. The enzyme was set to “trypsin” with two maximum missed\ncleavage sites and the search was against VLPSwiss_20140319.fasta (1332969\nentries). Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed\nmodification. Deamidation of asparagine and glutamine and oxidation of\nhistidine, methionine and tryptophan were specified as variable\nmodifications. Methylation at aspartic acid residues was specified only for\nMascot analyses conducted without PD. The .msf output files were integrated\ninto Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.7.3, Proteome Software Inc.) which was\nused to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications.\nIdentification of \nLh\n VLP proteins\n\n\nVLP proteins (\nTables S1\n, \nS2\n) reported here had at least two proteomic peptides,\nidentified at 99% or greater probability by either PD or solo Mascot\nsearches, that aligned to a target sequence. In addition, four proteins are\nincluded in the list where only one peptide aligned at 99% more\nprobability (see below, Protein sequence annotations subsection).\nFull-length target protein sequences were translated from RNA-Seq\n\nLh\n 14 (\nGAJC00000000.1\n) transcripts translated to ORFs\n[\n10\n].\n\n\nThe number of aligned peptides varied slightly between PD and Mascot\nanalyses conducted without PD. The PD results have been deposited to the\nProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE [\n42\n] partner repository (see \nKRT\n for link).\n\n\nIn this report, VLP composition is based on the subset of proteins\ncommon to both the \nLh\n 14 and NY strains. The common,\nfull-length VLP protein ORFs (\nTables S1\n, \nS2\n) were annotated via \n(A)\n primary\nsequence analyses, and \n(B)\n structure-based analyses and\npredictions for select proteins (described below). Note that the\n\nLh\n 14 dataset is larger and select \nLh\n\n14-unique sequences were preferentially included.\nAdditional verification of protein sequences\n\n\nThe VLP peptides were also searched against other proteomes (Uniprot\n\nD. melanogaster\n, \nA. mellifera\n,\n\nH. sapiens\n, viral, prokaryotic and archaea databases\n[\n43\n]). The\nfull-length proteins identified from the RNA-Seq ORFs [\n10\n] were BLASTed against\n\nLh\n ESTs (NCBI LIBEST 028179 and 028205, [\n11\n, \n12\n]), providing an alternative method of ORF sequence\nverification. This step also identified the full, or near full, length VLP\nprotein clones in our \nLh\n EST collection (e.g.,\n\nLh\n VLP Sm & LgGTPas01). Roughly 20% and\n~ 45% of the common VLP proteins were identified in the\nHeavner et al. 2013 [\n11\n] and the Colinet et al. 2013 [\n12\n] studies. (See below, for methods of\nidentification of absence/presence of expression of each \nLh\n\nVLP protein in \nLb\n 17 and G1 abdominal transcriptomes (\nFig 2\n).)\nProtein sequence annotations\n\n\nThe automated, pipe-line annotation algorithms of (1) BLAST2GO, E\n<= 10\n−5\n (v2.7.0) [\n44\n], (2) InterProScan (v5.3–46)\n[\n45\n], and (3)\nFastAnnotator [\n46\n]\nwere used to characterize all (common set) VLP proteins identified from VLP\npeptide alignments to \nLh\n transcriptome ORFs (See above).\nMultiple bioinformatic methods were used to avoid algorithm bias and\nincrease accuracy. Two related criteria were used as measures of reliability\nof annotations: (a) E values (E <= 10\n−5\n);\nand (b) percent identity and percent similarity (applied only when at least\n75% of the query aligned to the hit).\n\n\nFor manual annotations, BLASTs were conducted via NCBI\n[\n47\n] (nr and TSA\ndatabases, default parameters [\n48\n]). To identify potential \nLh\n VLP\nprotein homologs in microbiota, the unannotated full-length VLP proteins\nwere pBLAST searched against a subset of all nr archaea, viruses, and\nprokaryotic genomes at higher sensitivity (GenBank, E <=\n10). To identify \nLh\n VLP proteins expressed by\n\nLb\n 17 and \nG1\n, all VLP sequences were\ntBLASTn searched with default parameters against \nGAJA00000000.1\n (Lb 17) and\n\nGAIW00000000.1\n transcriptomes (\nGanaspis sp1\n\n(\nG1\n)) [\n10\n]. The Conserved Domains Database (CDD) [\n49\n, \n50\n] and PFAM [\n51\n] were used for domain identifications and\narchitectures. Manual annotation results are reported in main text only if\nthey were confirmed by a second method. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) Orthology (KO) numbers were assigned using GhostKOALA\n[\n52\n]. KO numbers\nwere then used to obtain model ortholog annotations.\n\n\nFor pairwise and multiple-sequence alignments, T-Coffee\n[\n53\n], Needleman\n[\n54\n],\nClustalOmega [\n55\n],\nand MUSCLE [\n56\n, \n57\n] (EBI webserver, default\nparameters) were used and ESPript 3.0 [\n58\n] was used for visualizations. FunRich\n[\n59\n] was used for\nfunctional enrichment and over-representation analyses against two\nextracellular vesicle databases, Exocarta [\n60\n, \n61\n] and Vesiclepedia [\n62\n]. Circos (v0.69) was used to visualize\nthe proteome [\n63\n].\n\n\nThe four proteins with only on a single aligned peptide (99%\nor greater peptide probability) (\nFig 3\n;\n\nTables S1\n,\n\nS2\n) passed the\n(1) manual inspections of their MS/MS spectra and fragments, (2) solo Mascot\nsearches, and (3) Exocarta/Vesiclepedia enrichment analyses. Of these four\nproteins, one is classified as novel (Class 3; \nFigs 2\n, \n3 A\n), while the\nother three have sequence similarities with eukaryotic proteins (Class 1;\n\nFig 2\n, \n3\n) of extracellular vesicles (\nFig 3 B, C\n).\nIn silico\n structural predictions of SmGTPase01\n\n\nA high-quality structural model was created for SmGTPase01 using a\nhybrid approach. A MODELLER [\n64\n] model was created using three templates: GIMAP\ncrystal structure 3V70 and two \nab initio\n models\n[\n65\n]. 3V70 was\nchosen using threading metaservers (LOMETS [\n66\n] and PHYRE2 [\n67\n]) and was evaluated in single-template\nMODELLER trials. Loop modeling and side-chain optimization were done using\nLoopy [\n68\n] and SCWRL4\n[\n69\n],\nrespectively. The active site of this full-length model is presented in\n\nFig 4 C\n; the remaining details of\nthe model will be published elsewhere.\n\n\nThe SmGTPase01 co-factor, Mg2+, was placed in the active\nsite based on COFACTOR [\n70\n] and was checked for positioning using WHAT IF\n[\n71\n]. GTP was\nplaced and checked for energy minimization in the SmGTPase01 active site\nwith Autodock Vina [\n72\n]. The cofactor and substrate placements were confirmed\nwith predictions from COACH [\n73\n], BSP-SLIM [\n74\n], and 3D Ligand [\n75\n].\n\n\nThe qualities and knowledge-based energy values of our models were\nassessed using ProSA-web [\n76\n] and Verify3D [\n77\n]. TM-Align was used to compare crystal structures and\nour \nin silico\n models [\n30\n]. STRIDE [\n78\n] was used to define secondary\nstructures from molecular coordinates. Crystal structure molecular files\ncame from the Protein Data Bank (\nhttp://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do\n).\nCloning and structural predictions of p40\n\n\nFor p40-specific proteomics, peptides isolated and digested from an\nanti-p40 positive SDS-PAGE gel band were sequenced at the Harvard\nMicrochemistry Facility by HPLC-MS/MS (Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap) and\nthen BLAST queried against NCBI \nGAJC00000000.1\n RNA-Seq \nLh\n\n14 database.\n\n\nFor p40 cloning and expression, the p40 IpaD-like central domain\n(CD) was amplified from venom gland cDNA and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO. Primer\nsequences are listed in \nKey Resource Table\n. The p40 central domain (amino acids 26\n– 240, \nFig 4 D\n) was expressed\nfrom a pTrcHisA subclone by addition of IPTG (1 mM, ThermoFisher\nScientific). \nE. coli\n BL21cells were lysed by freeze-thaw in\nlysis buffer (10% triton X, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris\nHCl, pH 6.8) with protease inhibitors (AEBSF-HCl 100 mM, aprotinin 80\nμM, bestatin 5 mM, E-64 1.5 mM, leupeptin 2 mM, pepstatin A 1 mM,\nSigma or Fermentas). Protein concentrations in all assays were determined\nwith Bradford reagent [\n79\n].\n\n\nFor the verification of p40 identity via western analyses, bacterial\nproteins were separated (SDS-PAGE, 5% stacking and 12%\nresolving), transferred to membrane (nitrocellulose, HyBond, Amersham Life\nScience), and blocked (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1 % Tween 20, 5%\nnonfat dry milk, 3% bovine serum albumin (1 hr, 25°C)).\nPrimary antibodies used were anti-p40 (1:1000) or anti-6X-His (1:1000; 12\nhr, 4°C). Alkaline-phosphatase-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody\n(1:2,500; 1 hour, 25°C), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolyphosphate\n(BCIP, Amresco), and nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT, Biotium) solutions in\nNaCl-Tris-MgCl\n2\n buffer (NTM, pH 9.5) were used for\ndetection.\n\n\nFor p40 structural predictions, \nab initio\n and\ntemplate fragment assembly methods [\n80\n] [\n65\n] were used along with N-terminal predictions from\nMODELLER’s loop methods [\n81\n–\n83\n].\nStructural optimizations were generated using ModRefiner [\n84\n]. The most N- and C-terminal\nresidues of p40 are predicted to be a signal peptide and transmembrane helix\nand were not modeled (\nFig\nS1 C\n). Crystal structures (\nhttp://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do\n) similar to our\n\nin silico\n p40 model were identified using DaliLITE\n[\n85\n].\nAntibiotic treatment of \nLv\n\n\n\n\nTo cure \nLv\n adults of the strain of Gram negative\n\nWolbachia\n endosymbionts [\n34\n], three successive generations of\n\nLv\n females were cultivated from infections of \ny\nw D. melanogaster\n egglays on fly food medium containing\nrifampicin at 0.75 mg/g (see Fly and Wasp Strain sections, above, for\nhusbandry and housing details). The next six generations of\n\nLv\n wasps were cultivated on larvae raised on standard,\nantibiotic-free medium, to assure no direct drug effects. Isogenized control\nwasps did not receive antibiotic treatment and were otherwise reared the\nsame way as experimental wasps. For PCR amplification of wasp genomic DNA,\nantibiotic-treated and control male and female wasps, no more than 1 week\nPE, were sorted into microfuge tubes and frozen at −20°C.\nGenomic DNA template was amplified for the absence or presence of (a)\n\nLv\n-specific \ngatB\n and\n\ncoxA\n genes of \nWolbachia\n, and (b) VLP\nprotein genes (p40 and Sm/LgGTPase01) (see Analyses of genomic sequences,\nbelow, and \nKRT\n).\nResults from all PCR amplification experiments supported the conclusions in\nthis study.\nAnalyses of genomic sequences\n\n\nTotal genomic DNA from \nLh\n, antibiotic-treated\n\nLv\n, and control wasps was obtained using a Qiagen DNA\nBlood and Tissue kit.

Highly similar secretion signal peptides are predicted at the\nN-termini of all GTPases (not shown).\n\n\n(B)\n The five most-similar ORFs found in the NCBI TSA\ntranscriptome for G1 (\nGAIW00000000.1\n) are shown aligned with\n\nLh\n VLP Sm/LgGTPase01s. Like the \nLh\n VLP\nGTPases, several putative G1 GTPases have predicted secretion signal\npeptides (not shown). Potential G1 homologs demonstrate >=\n31% and 35% identity (E <=\n3e\n−03\n and 4e\n−59\n) to\n\nLh\n VLP SmGTPase01 and LgGTPase01, respectively (given\n75% alignment coverage).\n\n\n(C)\n The five most-similar ORFs found in the NCBI TSA\ntranscriptome for \nLc\n (\nGAXY00000000.2\n) are shown aligned\nwith \nLh\n VLP Sm/LgGTPase01s. Similar to \nLh\n\nand G1 GTPases, multiple \nLc\n GTPases have predicted signal\nsequence peptides. The \nLc\n transcripts identified show\nsimilarity in the N-terminal G domain, but are generally much shorter than\nthe \nLh\n VLP GTPases. \nLh\n VLP SmGTPase01\nshows <= 34% identity to \nLc\n\ntranscripts (>= 75% alignment criterion, E\n>= 2e\n−34\n) and LgGTPase01 shows\n<= 44% identity (E >=\n3e\n−99\n), respectively. \nLc\n also\nparasitizes \nDrosophila\n spp., but its comparative virulence\nand phylogenetic distance are poorly characterized in comparison to\n\nLh\n and \nLb\n.\n\n\n(D)\n The most similar \nLh\n and\n\nLc\n sequences have been extracted from \n(C)\n\nand are shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIHMS899633-supplement-5.pdf\n (6.2MB, pdf)\nKey resource table\n\n\n\n\nNIHMS899633-supplement-Key_resource_table.pdf\n (93.8KB, pdf)",

Five of the putative homologs are from\n\nDrosophila\n spp. and are four from dsDNA insect viruses\n(granulovirus, ascovirus, and entomopoxvirus). Both sequences contain\nsecretion signal motifs, and multiple predicted disulfide bridges. The\n\nD. melanogaster\n diedel, a putative homolog, is a\nnegative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway.\n\n\n(B)\n A \nLh\n VLP enhancin-like protein is\naligned with similar prokaryotic sequences (BLAST2GO and Delta BLAST nr, 20\n– 42% identity; 5.33e\n−04\n\n<= E <= 9e\n−03\n).

A eukaryotic-specific SCP\ndomain, best characterized in plant pathogenesis defense proteins, has been\nidentified, as well as a putative secretion signal.\n\n\n(E)\n The \nLh\n VLP Bap31-like (CDD domain\ncd05380, E = 1.95 e\n−42\n) protein is aligned with\nfive similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 59 – 76% identity; 1\ne\n−126\n <= E <= 4\ne\n−83\n) from other insects, including two species of\nant (Florida carpenter and red imported fire ant), wasp (a Braconid and the\nJewel parasitoid), and \nDrosophila mojavensis\n. Canonical\nBap31 proteins regulate ER-stress-mediated apoptosis. Similar to these\nproteins, the \nLh\n VLP protein is predicted to encode three\ntransmembrane helices.\n\n\n(F)\n The \nLh\n VLP knottin-like (pfam11410\ndomain, E = 5.19 e\n−03\n) protein is aligned with\nfive similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 33 – 52% identity; 3\ne\n−08\n <= E <= 2\ne\n−02\n), four from insect species and one from the\neudicotyledon, \nMesembryanthemum crystallinum\n. Among the\nmost similar putative homologs are sequences from diverse insects:\nHymenoptera (sawfly and wasp), Diptera, and Hemipteran species. The sequence\ncontains a putative secretion signal motif and three predicted disulfide\nbridges. 40% of the VLP sequence shows notable conservation\n(54% identity) when compared to a secreted ion channel toxin from\nthe spider \nChilobrachys guangxiensis\n (Arachnida:\nTheraphosidae). Knottins are classified as a cystine-rich plant\nantimicrobial peptide family.\n\n\n(G)\n The \nLh\n VLP hemolymph juvenile\nhormone binding protein (JHBP)-like (pfam06585 domain, E = 6.10\ne\n−17\n) protein is aligned with four similar sequences\n(BLASTp nr, 24 – 30% identity; 1 e\n−11\n\n<= E <= 6 e\n−03\n) from a\nwheat stem sawfly, the Panamanian leafcutter ant, the diamondback moth, and\n\nDrosophila melanogaster\n. No high identity homologs were\nfound, but moderately similar homologs were found encoded by wasps, ants,\nand arthropods, in general. Homologs in \nDrosophila\n spp.\nwere found, but are not functionally well characterized.

Additional putative GTPase family members exist, but are not presented\nhere. The first three sequences of ~ 300 residues, are SmGTPases,\nwhile the following five sequences of ~ 500 residues are LgGTPases.\nAmong the eight family members shown here, the percent similarities within\nthe N-terminal regions range from ~ 25 to 60% and average\npairwise similarity over their full lengths is 45%. Only seven\ninsertion/deletion sites exist in this 222 amino acid alignment and large\nblocks of identity (> 80% of the alignment length) are\npresent. Highly similar secretion signal peptides are predicted at the\nN-termini of all GTPases (not shown).\n\n\n(B)\n The five most-similar ORFs found in the NCBI TSA\ntranscriptome for G1 (\nGAIW00000000.1\n) are shown aligned with\n\nLh\n VLP Sm/LgGTPase01s. Like the \nLh\n VLP\nGTPases, several putative G1 GTPases have predicted secretion signal\npeptides (not shown). Potential G1 homologs demonstrate >=\n31% and 35% identity (E <=\n3e\n−03\n and 4e\n−59\n) to\n\nLh\n VLP SmGTPase01 and LgGTPase01, respectively (given\n75% alignment coverage).\n\n\n(C)\n The five most-similar ORFs found in the NCBI TSA\ntranscriptome for \nLc\n (\nGAXY00000000.2\n) are shown aligned\nwith \nLh\n VLP Sm/LgGTPase01s. Similar to \nLh\n\nand G1 GTPases, multiple \nLc\n GTPases have predicted signal\nsequence peptides. The \nLc\n transcripts identified show\nsimilarity in the N-terminal G domain, but are generally much shorter than\nthe \nLh\n VLP GTPases. \nLh\n VLP SmGTPase01\nshows <= 34% identity to \nLc\n\ntranscripts (>= 75% alignment criterion, E\n>= 2e\n−34\n) and LgGTPase01 shows\n<= 44% identity (E >=\n3e\n−99\n), respectively. \nLc\n also\nparasitizes \nDrosophila\n spp., but its comparative virulence\nand phylogenetic distance are poorly characterized in comparison to\n\nLh\n and \nLb\n.\n\n\n(D)\n The most similar \nLh\n and\n\nLc\n sequences have been extracted from \n(C)\n\nand are shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIHMS899633-supplement-5.pdf\n (6.2MB, pdf) \n\n\nKey resource table\n\n\n\n\nNIHMS899633-supplement-Key_resource_table.pdf\n (93.8KB, pdf)",

Experimental methods are necessary to validate these p40 model predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIHMS899633-supplement-1.pdf\n (2.2MB, pdf)\n2. Table S1: ORFs identified via alignment to \nLh\n VLP\npeptides (Related to \nFigs 2\n, \n3\n).\nA summary of proteomic data for proteins common to\n\nLh\n 14 (Gel01) and \nLh\n NY (Gel02) VLPs\npurified on Nycodenz gradients is presented here. The data are organized by\nour in-house VLP_Swiss-Prot identifiers. The wasp strain (column 6) from\nwhich the greatest number of VLP protein peptides were detected is provided\nfirst (columns 2 – 5). Data shown include protein identification\nprobability, peptide to protein alignment coverage, exclusive unique\nspectra, and exclusive unique peptides. The number of unique peptides\ndetected from the second \nLh\n strain’s VLPs (column\n8) for each protein is given in column 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIHMS899633-supplement-2.xlsx\n (50.4KB, xlsx)\n3. Table S2: Detailed report of proteomic peptides and modifications\n(Related to \nFigs 2\n, \n3\n).\nThis table provides additional information not presented in the\npeptide-to-ORF table (Table S1). The peptide sequences detected for each\nprotein from both \nLh\n 14 (Gel01) and \nLh\n NY\n(Gel02) VLP preparations are provided along with post-translational\nmodifications (columns 1, 2, and 11, respectively). The SDS-PAGE gel band of\norigin for each peptide can be found in column 23 (i.e., spectrum file ID).\nAny redundancies in protein identifications per peptide are provided in\ncolumns 21 and 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIHMS899633-supplement-3.xlsx\n (698.4KB, xlsx)\n4\nData S1: Select infection- and immunity-related\n\nLh\n VLP protein alignments (Related to\n\n\nFigs 2\n, \n3A\n)\n\n\nSeven \n(A–G)\n Class 2 \nLh\n VLP\nproteins aligned with their most similar putative homologs from prokaryotic,\nviral, and eukaryotic species (emphasis on Hymenotpera and Diptera). If\nsequences were trimmed, the absolute residue range is given following the\nspecies of origin. The coloring scheme is based on physiochemical\nproperties. ORF = open reading frame\n\n\n(A)\n Two diedel-like \nLh\n VLP sequences\nwith pfam13164 domains identified (E = 2.29e\n−12\n\nand 1.17e\n−07\n, diedel-like 1 and 2, respectively) are\naligned with nine similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 25 – 53%\nidentity; 7e\n−08\n <= E <=\n3e\n−01\n). Five of the putative homologs are from\n\nDrosophila\n spp. and are four from dsDNA insect viruses\n(granulovirus, ascovirus, and entomopoxvirus). Both sequences contain\nsecretion signal motifs, and multiple predicted disulfide bridges. The\n\nD. melanogaster\n diedel, a putative homolog, is a\nnegative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway.\n\n\n(B)\n A \nLh\n VLP enhancin-like protein is\naligned with similar prokaryotic sequences (BLAST2GO and Delta BLAST nr, 20\n– 42% identity; 5.33e\n−04\n\n<= E <= 9e\n−03\n). Multiple\nsequences from \nYersinia, Listeria\n, and other pathogenic\nbacterial species were found in our BLASTs and, in a few cases, these\nsequences were annotated as M60 peptidases. The VLP sequence contains a\nputative secretion signal motif, but no known domains were identified. It is\nnotable that enhancin homologs encoded in viral genomes were not uncovered\nin our searches.\n\n\n(C)\n A \nLh\n VLP GH18 chitinase-like\nsuperfamily (CDD cd02873 domain, E = 0) protein is aligned with five\nsimilar sequences (BLASTp nr, 50 – 75% identity; 0\n<= E <= 2 e\n−143\n) from\nother insects, including the yellow-fever mosquito, the Tobacco horn worm,\nand three parasitoid wasps (the Jewel and two Braconid wasps). The VLP\nprotein sequence encodes a predicted secretion signal and is predicted to be\nan Imaginal disc growth factor (Idgf)-like protein, a superfamily that\ndiverged from chitinase-like proteins.\n\n\n(D)\n The \nLh\n VLP venom allergen-like\n(CDD domain cd05380, E = 1.95 e\n−42\n) protein is\naligned with five similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 37 – 42%\nidentity; 6 e\n−41\n<= E <= 6\ne\n−34\n) from other insects, including the red imported\nfire ant, the Panamanian leafcutter ant, and three parasitoid wasps (Jewel,\na Braconid wasp, and a Chalcidoid egg parasite). A eukaryotic-specific SCP\ndomain, best characterized in plant pathogenesis defense proteins, has been\nidentified, as well as a putative secretion signal.\n\n\n(E)\n The \nLh\n VLP Bap31-like (CDD domain\ncd05380, E = 1.95 e\n−42\n) protein is aligned with\nfive similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 59 – 76% identity; 1\ne\n−126\n <= E <= 4\ne\n−83\n) from other insects, including two species of\nant (Florida carpenter and red imported fire ant), wasp (a Braconid and the\nJewel parasitoid), and \nDrosophila mojavensis\n. Canonical\nBap31 proteins regulate ER-stress-mediated apoptosis. Similar to these\nproteins, the \nLh\n VLP protein is predicted to encode three\ntransmembrane helices.\n\n\n(F)\n The \nLh\n VLP knottin-like (pfam11410\ndomain, E = 5.19 e\n−03\n) protein is aligned with\nfive similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 33 – 52% identity; 3\ne\n−08\n <= E <= 2\ne\n−02\n), four from insect species and one from the\neudicotyledon, \nMesembryanthemum crystallinum\n. Among the\nmost similar putative homologs are sequences from diverse insects:\nHymenoptera (sawfly and wasp), Diptera, and Hemipteran species. The sequence\ncontains a putative secretion signal motif and three predicted disulfide\nbridges. 40% of the VLP sequence shows notable conservation\n(54% identity) when compared to a secreted ion channel toxin from\nthe spider \nChilobrachys guangxiensis\n (Arachnida:\nTheraphosidae). Knottins are classified as a cystine-rich plant\nantimicrobial peptide family.\n\n\n(G)\n The \nLh\n VLP hemolymph juvenile\nhormone binding protein (JHBP)-like (pfam06585 domain, E = 6.10\ne\n−17\n) protein is aligned with four similar sequences\n(BLASTp nr, 24 – 30% identity; 1 e\n−11\n\n<= E <= 6 e\n−03\n) from a\nwheat stem sawfly, the Panamanian leafcutter ant, the diamondback moth, and\n\nDrosophila melanogaster\n. No high identity homologs were\nfound, but moderately similar homologs were found encoded by wasps, ants,\nand arthropods, in general. Homologs in \nDrosophila\n spp.\nwere found, but are not functionally well characterized. The regions of\nsimilarities are within 80 to 90% of the length of the VLP protein\nsequence, but largely only in comparisons to putative homologs from other\nhymenoptera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIHMS899633-supplement-4.pdf\n (13.5MB, pdf)\n5\nData S2: \nLh\n VLP GTPase alignments (Related\nto\n\n\nFigs 2\n, \n3A\n, & \n4A –\nC\n)\n\n\nThis document provides alignments of select small and large VLP\nGTPases (including SmGTPases01/LgGTPases01) with putative homologs/paralogs\nfrom \n(A)\n\n\nLh\n; \n(B)\n prokaryotic and eukaryotic species;\n\n(C)\n\n\nGanaspis sp.1\n (G1); and \n(D, E)\n\n\nLeptopilina clavipes\n (\nLc\n). The far N-and\nC-termini show the most variation among the sequences and were trimmed. The\nresidue range displayed is indicated after the species of origin. The\ncoloring scheme is according to physiochemical properties. ORF =\nopen reading frame.\n\n\n(A)\n Eight \nLh\n VLP GTPases are presented\nhere. Additional putative GTPase family members exist, but are not presented\nhere. The first three sequences of ~ 300 residues, are SmGTPases,\nwhile the following five sequences of ~ 500 residues are LgGTPases.\nAmong the eight family members shown here, the percent similarities within\nthe N-terminal regions range from ~ 25 to 60% and average\npairwise similarity over their full lengths is 45%. Only seven\ninsertion/deletion sites exist in this 222 amino acid alignment and large\nblocks of identity (> 80% of the alignment length) are\npresent. Highly similar secretion signal peptides are predicted at the\nN-termini of all GTPases (not shown).\n\n\n(B)\n The five most-similar ORFs found in the NCBI TSA\ntranscriptome for G1 (\nGAIW00000000.1\n) are shown aligned with\n\nLh\n VLP Sm/LgGTPase01s. Like the \nLh\n VLP\nGTPases, several putative G1 GTPases have predicted secretion signal\npeptides (not shown). Potential G1 homologs demonstrate >=\n31% and 35% identity (E <=\n3e\n−03\n and 4e\n−59\n) to\n\nLh\n VLP SmGTPase01 and LgGTPase01, respectively (given\n75% alignment coverage).\n\n\n(C)\n The five most-similar ORFs found in the NCBI TSA\ntranscriptome for \nLc\n (\nGAXY00000000.2\n) are shown aligned\nwith \nLh\n VLP Sm/LgGTPase01s. Similar to \nLh\n\nand G1 GTPases, multiple \nLc\n GTPases have predicted signal\nsequence peptides. The \nLc\n transcripts identified show\nsimilarity in the N-terminal G domain, but are generally much shorter than\nthe \nLh\n VLP GTPases. \nLh\n VLP SmGTPase01\nshows <= 34% identity to \nLc\n\ntranscripts (>= 75% alignment criterion, E\n>= 2e\n−34\n) and LgGTPase01 shows\n<= 44% identity (E >=\n3e\n−99\n), respectively. \nLc\n also\nparasitizes \nDrosophila\n spp., but its comparative virulence\nand phylogenetic distance are poorly characterized in comparison to\n\nLh\n and \nLb\n.\n\n\n(D)\n The most similar \nLh\n and\n\nLc\n sequences have been extracted from \n(C)\n\nand are shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIHMS899633-supplement-5.pdf\n (6.2MB, pdf)\nKey resource table\n\n\n\n\nNIHMS899633-supplement-Key_resource_table.pdf\n (93.8KB, pdf)",
