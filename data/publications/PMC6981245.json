    "introduction": "Spaceflight exposes organisms to numerous environmental stressors, such as gravitational changes, radiation, temperature fluctuations, vibration, noise, confinement, and disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms. Previous studies of animals and humans after travel in space have documented alterations in several tissues and organ systems, including skeletal, immune, cardiovascular, nervous and gastrointestinal (e.g., \nBorchers et al., 2002\n; \nHargens and Richardson, 2009\n; \nNagaraja and Risin, 2013\n; \nLatchney et al., 2014\n; \nPorseva et al., 2017\n; \nDemontis et al., 2017\n; \nGarrett-Bakelman et al., 2019\n). Early and more recent studies have demonstrated that oral hard and soft tissues, including the mandible (\nSimmons et al., 1983\n; \nGhosh et al., 2016\n; \nDagdeviren et al., 2018b\n), teeth (\nRosenberg et al., 1984\n; \nDagdeviren et al., 2018b\n), salivary glands (\nGroza et al., 1981\n, \n1983\n; \nMednieks and Hand, 1985\n, \n1987\n; \nMednieks et al., 2014\n, \n2015\n; \nDagdeviren et al., 2018a\n) and saliva (\nBrown et al., 1977\n), are significantly affected by spaceflight.\nThe response of rodent salivary glands to spaceflight varies among glands and cell types. An increase in autophagy and apoptosis occurs in parotid acinar cells (\nMednieks et al., 2014\n, \n2015\n). Large endocytic vacuoles containing acinar cell proteins are present in intercalated and striated duct cells. Changes also occur in the expression of several acinar cell secretory proteins. In contrast, the sublingual gland shows few morphological alterations, but changes do occur in serous demilune cell protein expression (\nDagdeviren et al., 2018a\n).\nThe aims of the present study were to determine if spaceflight affects the morphology and secretory protein expression of the mouse submandibular gland. Glands from mice flown on two US space shuttle flights and from the Russian Bion-M1 satellite, along with ground control mice, were examined using transmission electron microcopy, immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling. The findings indicate that the three major salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight and suggest that the age and sex of the animals and the length of the flight affect the response.",
    "materials_and_methods": "Animals:\n\n\nEight 16-23 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 15 d on space shuttle Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131), and seven 9 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 13 d on space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135). The mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules, specially designed cages that provide ventilation, lighting, waste collection, food and water (\nMorey-Holton et al., 2000\n). Eight mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 15 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-131 flight, and 5 mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 13 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-135 flight. Six 15-16 wk old male C57BL/6N mice were flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 satellite. The mice were housed in “BOS” flight habitats (\nAndreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014\n). Four age-matched male C57BL/6N mice housed in the same flight habitats served as asynchronous ground controls. The experimental procedures were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Moscow State University Institute of Mitoengineering (Protocol No-35, 1 November, 2012), and the Biomedical Ethics Commission of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (Moscow) (protocol No–319, 4 April, 2013). All procedures conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health \nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n, and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. The samples were made available through the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program.\n\n\nFlight and habitat ground control mice on the space shuttle missions were provided with NASA rodent food bars (\nSun et al., 2014\n) attached to the sides of the Animal Enclosure Modules and water \nad libitum\n. Five mice housed in standard vivarium cages, with rodent chow and water available \nad libitum\n, served as additional ground control animals for the STS-135 mission. Flight and habitat ground control mice on the Bion-M1 mission were fed a paste diet based on standard rodent chow, with water and casein added as a gelling agent (\nAndreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014\n). The paste food was available at 4 h intervals. Four additional ground control mice were housed in standard vivarium cages and fed rodent chow and water \nad libitum\n. Pre- and post-flight body weight and food consumption data have been published (\nMednieks et al., 2014\n; \nDagdeviren et al., 2018b\n).\nSample Collection:\n\n\nDissection of the mice from the space shuttle flights began about 3 h after landing of the shuttles at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida; dissection of the habitat ground control mice took place 48 h after the flight mice. The vivarium-housed mice were dissected 48 h prior to dissection of the STS-135 flight mice. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Dissection of the Bion-M1 flight mice took place at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow, beginning about 13 h after landing in the Orenburg region of Russia. The mice were killed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The vivarium control mice were dissected immediately after the flight mice, and the asynchronous habitat ground control mice were dissected 99 days after the flight mice.\n\n\nSubmandibular glands were removed, rinsed briefly in cold phosphate buffered saline and prepared for morphological and immunohistochemical examination. Small pieces of tissue for morphologic analysis were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Samples for immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. After overnight fixation at 4°C, the samples were rinsed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and stored in either buffer (morphology) or 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (immunohistochemistry). The samples were shipped cold by express service from the dissection sites to UConn Health.\nMorphologic Analysis:\n\n\nThe samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide/0.8% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, stained in block with 1% uranyl acetate, and processed by standard methods (\nHand, 1995\n) for embedding in PolyBed epoxy resin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). Thin sections (~70-80 nm) were collected on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined and photographed in a Hitachi H7650 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT digital camera.\nImmunohistochemistry:\n\n\nParaformaldehyde-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, sections were cut at 5 μm thickness, and immunohistochemistry was carried out as described previously (\nLe et al., 2011\n), using the Vectastain Elite kits for rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. The sections were observed and photographed using a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA) equipped with an Accu-Scope Excelis digital camera (Accu-Scope, Commack, NY, USA).\nImmunogold Labeling:\n\n\nPostfixation was omitted, and the paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were rinsed briefly in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in cold methanol solutions, embedded in LR Gold resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and polymerized in UV light at −20°C. Thin sections from each mouse of the flight and ground control groups from the three missions were collected on formvar-coated nickel grids. Immunolabeling was carried out overnight at 4°C as described previously (\nDagdeviren et al., 2018a\n), using primary antibodies (\nTable 1\n) diluted in phosphate buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum. Immunolabeling controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected with gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Int., Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK, or Aurion, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The labeled grids were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in the transmission electron microscope.\n\n\nTable 1:\n\n\nAntibodies Used for Immunohistochemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n(Species)\n\n\nLM Dilution\n\n\nEM Dilution\n\n\nReference/Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSABPα\n(Rabbit)\n\n\n1:2000 – 1:10000\n\n\n1:25 - 1:200\n\n\nL.

Labeling densities of secretory granules of acinar cells, terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells, and granular convoluted duct cells were calculated for each mouse as the average number of gold particles/μm\n2\n. For direct comparison between different immunogold labeling experiments, the labeling densities were converted to percentages of the corresponding ground control averages. Differences in expression of each protein between the flight and ground control groups were evaluated using ANOVA and t-test functions in Microsoft Excel or StatPlus (v.6.1.60, AnalystSoft, Walnut, CA, USA).\nAntibodies:\n\n\nPrimary antibodies used were to salivary androgen binding protein alpha (SABPα), proline-rich protein (PRP), submandibular gland protein C (SMGC), nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (\nTable 1\n). A rabbit anti-chicken antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; Cat No. ab97136) was used as a secondary antibody with the chicken anti-PRP primary.",

    "immunohistochemistry:": "In paraffin sections, antibodies to SABPα labeled all of the submandibular gland acinar cells (\nFig. 3A\n), whereas no reactivity was present in duct cells. Antibody to NGF labeled the granular convoluted duct cells (\nFig. 3B\n). In female mice, the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells were labeled with antibody to SMGC (\nFig. 3C\n, \nD\n).

The labeling density for SABPα in female mice flown on STS-131 and STS-135 was not significantly different than in habitat ground control mice. In male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite, labeling for SABPα was significantly increased in flight mice compared to habitat control mice (\nFig. 5\n).

Results are expressed as a percentage ± standard error of the mean of the habitat-housed ground control mice. *, p<0.01.\nIn the granular convoluted duct cells, immunogold labeling with antibodies to EGF and NGF resulted in labeling of the secretory granules (\nFig. 4C\n, \nD\n). In our samples fixed only in paraformaldehyde, the secretory granules exhibited variable electron density. The immunogold labeling density is reported only for the electron dense and moderately electron dense granules. No differences were seen in the labeling densities for EGF and NGF between female flight and habitat ground control mice in the STS-131 and STS-135 missions. Although the EGF labeling was decreased in STS-135 flight mice, it was not significantly different from the habitat ground control mice due to substantial variability among the individual mice. Labeling for both EGF and NGF, however, was significantly increased in male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite compared to habitat ground control mice (\nFig. 5\n).\nThe labeling of terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells in female mice from the STS-131 and STS-135 missions with antibody to SMGC (\nFig. 4E\n) showed no difference between flight and habitat ground controls (\nFig. 5\n).\nGround control vivarium mice were available for study for the STS-135 and Bion-M1 missions. Labeling of female vivarium control mice from the STS-135 mission with antibodies to PRP, EGF, NGF and SMGC was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling for SABPα, however, was greater in vivarium control mice than in flight mice (p<0.01) and habitat control mice (p<0.05). Labeling of male vivarium control mice from the Bion-M1 mission with antibodies to PRP and EGF was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling of vivarium control mice for SABPα and NGF was significantly less than in flight mice (p<0.05), but no different from habitat control mice.\nNon-specific labeling of sections incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune IgG instead of primary antibody was generally very low, in most cases in the range of 0% to 6% of the specific antibody labeling of secretory granules.

    "results": "The flight and habitat ground control mice from both space shuttle missions lost approximately 1-2 g of body weight (\nMednieks et al., 2014\n), but the differences were not statistically significant. Consumption of food and water were similar for the flight and habitat ground control mice. The flight and habitat ground control mice from the Bion-M1 mission gained approximately 2-2.5 g body weight; the differences were significant for the flight mice (p = 0.0010) and habitat ground control mice (p = 0.0456) (\nAndreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014\n). Food consumption for the flight and habitat ground control mice, determined in preliminary experiments, was identical.\nMorphology:\n\n\nThe acinar cells of the mouse submandibular gland are seromucous in nature, with a basally located nucleus, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in the basal cytoplasm, a large Golgi complex, and secretory granules with a granular content of moderate density located in the supranuclear cytoplasm (\nFig. 1 A\n, \nB\n; see review by \nDenny et al., 1997\n). In adult female glands, terminal tubule cells, also called granular intercalated duct cells, retained from prenatal and early postnatal stages, often are observed at the acinar-intercalated duct junction (\nCaramia, 1966a\n; \nGresik and MaRae, 1975\n; \nHayashi and Sasa, 1989\n; \nYamamoto et al., 2018\n) (\nFig. 1C\n). These cells contain numerous small dense secretory granules ranging in size from 0.6 to 1.3 μm. In males, the terminal tubule cells undergo androgen-dependent apoptosis and are completely lost by about 1 month of age (\nHayashi et al., 2000\n; \nHecht et al., 2000\n; \nYamamoto et al., 2018\n). The intercalated ducts, consisting of cuboidal cells that occasionally contain a few small granules, connect to a short striated granular duct (\nCaramia, 1966a\n; \nGresik and MacRae, 1975\n; \nDenny et al., 1990\n) which is confluent with the granular convoluted duct. The granular convoluted ducts consist of tall columnar cells, with basal nuclei, variably infolded basal cell membranes with adjacent mitochondria, and numerous large dense granules in the supranuclear cytoplasm. (\nFig. 2\n) As described by \nWatson et al. (1985)\n, smaller dense granules often are present in the cytoplasm between the large granules. These ducts are well-developed in adult male glands, constituting about 45% to 60% of the gland parenchyma (\nCaramia, 1966a\n; \nGresik, 1994\n; \nJayasinghe et al., 1990\n; \nPardini and Taga, 1996\n) (\nFig. 2A\n). In female glands, the granular convoluted duct cells are smaller than those of males, contain fewer secretory granules (\nFig. 2B\n), and constitute about 25% of the parenchyma. The granular convoluted ducts are confluent with the striated ducts, which become excretory ducts as they enter the connective tissue septa dividing the gland into lobules and lobes.\n\n\nFigure 1:\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nA,\n Space Transportation System (STS)-135.

The labeling density for PRP was unchanged from controls in both female and male flight mice.\n\n\nFigure 4:\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nElectron microscopic immunogold labeling. \nA,\n Bion-M1.

Results are expressed as a percentage ± standard error of the mean of the habitat-housed ground control mice. *, p<0.01.\nIn the granular convoluted duct cells, immunogold labeling with antibodies to EGF and NGF resulted in labeling of the secretory granules (\nFig. 4C\n, \nD\n). In our samples fixed only in paraformaldehyde, the secretory granules exhibited variable electron density. The immunogold labeling density is reported only for the electron dense and moderately electron dense granules. No differences were seen in the labeling densities for EGF and NGF between female flight and habitat ground control mice in the STS-131 and STS-135 missions. Although the EGF labeling was decreased in STS-135 flight mice, it was not significantly different from the habitat ground control mice due to substantial variability among the individual mice. Labeling for both EGF and NGF, however, was significantly increased in male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite compared to habitat ground control mice (\nFig. 5\n).\n\n\nThe labeling of terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells in female mice from the STS-131 and STS-135 missions with antibody to SMGC (\nFig. 4E\n) showed no difference between flight and habitat ground controls (\nFig. 5\n).\n\n\nGround control vivarium mice were available for study for the STS-135 and Bion-M1 missions. Labeling of female vivarium control mice from the STS-135 mission with antibodies to PRP, EGF, NGF and SMGC was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling for SABPα, however, was greater in vivarium control mice than in flight mice (p<0.01) and habitat control mice (p<0.05). Labeling of male vivarium control mice from the Bion-M1 mission with antibodies to PRP and EGF was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling of vivarium control mice for SABPα and NGF was significantly less than in flight mice (p<0.05), but no different from habitat control mice.\n\n\nNon-specific labeling of sections incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune IgG instead of primary antibody was generally very low, in most cases in the range of 0% to 6% of the specific antibody labeling of secretory granules. Non-specific binding of primary antibodies to plastic in interstitial areas ranged from 0.37% to less than 5%.",
    "morphology:": "The acinar cells of the mouse submandibular gland are seromucous in nature, with a basally located nucleus, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in the basal cytoplasm, a large Golgi complex, and secretory granules with a granular content of moderate density located in the supranuclear cytoplasm (\nFig. 1 A\n, \nB\n; see review by \nDenny et al., 1997\n). In adult female glands, terminal tubule cells, also called granular intercalated duct cells, retained from prenatal and early postnatal stages, often are observed at the acinar-intercalated duct junction (\nCaramia, 1966a\n; \nGresik and MaRae, 1975\n; \nHayashi and Sasa, 1989\n; \nYamamoto et al., 2018\n) (\nFig. 1C\n). These cells contain numerous small dense secretory granules ranging in size from 0.6 to 1.3 μm. In males, the terminal tubule cells undergo androgen-dependent apoptosis and are completely lost by about 1 month of age (\nHayashi et al., 2000\n; \nHecht et al., 2000\n; \nYamamoto et al., 2018\n). The intercalated ducts, consisting of cuboidal cells that occasionally contain a few small granules, connect to a short striated granular duct (\nCaramia, 1966a\n; \nGresik and MacRae, 1975\n; \nDenny et al., 1990\n) which is confluent with the granular convoluted duct. The granular convoluted ducts consist of tall columnar cells, with basal nuclei, variably infolded basal cell membranes with adjacent mitochondria, and numerous large dense granules in the supranuclear cytoplasm. (\nFig. 2\n) As described by \nWatson et al. (1985)\n, smaller dense granules often are present in the cytoplasm between the large granules. These ducts are well-developed in adult male glands, constituting about 45% to 60% of the gland parenchyma (\nCaramia, 1966a\n; \nGresik, 1994\n; \nJayasinghe et al., 1990\n; \nPardini and Taga, 1996\n) (\nFig. 2A\n). In female glands, the granular convoluted duct cells are smaller than those of males, contain fewer secretory granules (\nFig. 2B\n), and constitute about 25% of the parenchyma. The granular convoluted ducts are confluent with the striated ducts, which become excretory ducts as they enter the connective tissue septa dividing the gland into lobules and lobes.\nFigure 1:\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nA,\n Space Transportation System (STS)-135.

    "discussion": "In the submandibular gland, as in the parotid and sublingual glands of these mice, spaceflight resulted in specific changes in secretory protein expression. Male mice flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 biosatellite had an increased content of SABPα in acinar cell secretory granules, and EGF and NGF in granular convoluted duct cell secretory granules, when compared to that in the habitat ground control mice. This appears to be a specific effect of microgravity. The shorter 13 d and 15 d flights on the space shuttle, however, did not cause increased expression of these proteins in female glands. This suggests that longer exposure to microgravity may result in more profound changes. Other factors also may play a role, such as the age and sex of the mice, stresses during landing given the different space craft, and the time elapsed between landing and dissection. It is possible that the different diets consumed by the mice on the space shuttle flights compared to those on the Bion-M1 flight could have resulted in differences in protein expression. The comparisons in the present study, therefore, are made between the flight mice and habitat ground control mice that were fed the same diets.\nSABPα, also known as SCGB1B27, is a member of the secretoglobin protein family. Secretoglobins bind lipophilic ligands and are present in mammals and birds (\nLaukaitis et al., 2005\n; \nJackson et al., 2011\n). In the mouse submandibular gland, SABPα forms heterotetramers with β and γ subunits; the complex binds androgens and acts as a pheromone involved in mate selection (\nLaukaitis et al., 1997\n). Previous studies have shown that its expression is similar in male and female mice (\nWickliffe et al., 2002\n), although some paralogues expressed in the female submandibular gland are not present in the male submandibular gland (\nLaukaitis et al., 2005\n). Although the pathways regulating SABPα expression are not known, the spaceflight environment, and specifically microgravity, significantly upregulates its expression in male mice after 30 d in space.\nThe PRPs are expressed in the submandibular and parotid glands of humans, rodents and other species, are secreted into saliva, and have bacterial, calcium, tannin and polyphenol binding functions (\nOppenheim et al., 1971\n; \nBennick 1982\n, \n2002\n; \nGibbons and Hay, 1988\n, \n1989\n; \nTakano et al., 1993\n). Their synthesis is enhanced by dietary tannins and by the administration of isoproterenol (\nFernandez-Sorensen and Carlson, 1974\n; \nMehansho and Carlson, 1983\n; \nMehansho et al., 1985\n; \nDivecha et al., 1989\n; \nMatsuura and Hand, 1991\n). Regulation of PRP gene expression by tannins and β-adrenergic agonists occurs via the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A signaling system (\nCarlson, 1993\n; \nAnn and Lin, 1998\n), whose responses vary with the amount of stress imposed on the system. Long-term spaceflight appears to have minimal effects on components of the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A system (\nMednieks et al., 2014\n, \n2015\n; \nDagdeviren et al., 2018a\n, \n2018b\n). Relatively modest changes in the levels of salivary and plasma corticosteroids and catecholamines occur as a result of spaceflight in both animals and humans (\nKvetnansky et al., 1981\n, \n1991\n; \nMacho et al., 1996\n, \n2001\n, \n2004\n; \nLarina et al., 1997\n; \nStrollo et al., 1997\n; \nBlottner et al., 2009\n; \nBuchheim et al., 2019\n). This suggests that the mice from these missions experienced minimal stress due to the spaceflight environment. Stress associated with landing and post-flight readaptation to gravity potentially could affect the salivary glands. However, the relatively short interval between landing and tissue collection for the STS-131 and STS-135 flights may have minimized such effects. This is supported by the lack of significant changes in PRP expression.\nSMGC, a secretory protein of unknown function, is produced by the terminal tubule cells of neonatal rats and mice (\nBall et al., 1988\n; \nZinzen et al., 2004\n). As the terminal tubule cells decline in number beyond 20 d of age in females, and disappear in males (\nHayashi et al., 2000\n; \nHecht et al., 2000\n; \nYamamoto et al., 2018\n), the levels of SMGC transcripts and protein detectable in the submandibular gland are greatly diminished (\nHecht et al., 2000\n; \nZinzen et al., 2004\n). SMGC expression in females is decreased after ovariectomy and increased by β-estradiol administration (\nKusakabe et al., 2016\n). No differences in immunogold labeling were observed for the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells present in the submandibular gland of the female mice flown on the two space shuttle missions. This suggests that SMGC expression is not affected by microgravity. Alternatively, the length of exposure to microgravity (13-15 d) may have been insufficient to induce changes in SMGC expression.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that granular convoluted duct structure and protein expression are dependent on androgens and thyroid hormones, and that the expression of EGF and NGF is much greater in the adult male submandibular gland than in the female submandibular gland (\nCaramia, 1966b\n; \nChretien, 1977\n; \nAloe and Levi-Montalcini, 1980\n; \nMatsuura et al., 1984\n; \nGubits et al., 1986\n; \nKasayama et al., 1989\n; \nGresik, 1994\n; \nAdthapanyawanich et al., 2015\n; \nYamanoto et al., 2018\n). While plasma levels of androgens and thyroid hormones were not determined in the male mice from the Bion-M1 mission, previous studies have shown decreased plasma testosterone in rats (\nAmann et al., 1992\n; \nMacho et al., 2001\n), and decreased plasma, salivary and urinary testosterone in astronauts (\nStrollo et al., 1998\n; \nStrollo, 1999\n). Decreases in thyroid function and plasma levels of thyroid hormones after spaceflight have been observed in rodents and humans (\nPlakhuta-Plakutina et al., 1990\n; \nStrollo, 1999\n; \nMacho et al., 2001\n; \nSmith et al., 2011\n). The increase in EGF and NGF expression in the granular convoluted duct cells of the Bion-M1 flight mice thus was unexpected. However, androgens and thyroid hormones also act through non-classic nongenomic pathways (\nForadori et al., 2008\n; \nCheng et al., 2010\n; \nHammes and Davis, 2015\n); it is possible that microgravity may influence EGF and NGF expression via signaling intermediates that intersect with these pathways. The increased expression of both EGF and NGF by approximately 60% in flight mice compared to habitat ground control mice suggests that the same regulatory pathway(s) was activated for both genes.\nWatson et al. (1985)\n, using double labeling with different size gold particles, showed that all moderate to large size granules of the granular convoluted duct cells contain both EGF and NGF. They also observed small unreactive granules and suggested that they may contain other granular convoluted duct cell proteins, or perhaps precursors to EGF and NGF that did not react with their antibodies. Similar small granules, occasionally labeled with EGF and NGF antibodies, were observed in the present study. It was not clear whether these labeled granules represent a separate population from the medium to large size granules, or whether they were tangential sections through the larger granules.\nAutophagic vacuoles and apoptotic acinar cells were observed more frequently in the parotid glands of the flight mice from these three missions than in the corresponding ground controls (\nMednieks et al., 2014\n, \n2015\n). In other studies an increase in autophagy and apoptosis in various tissues and in cultured cells was observed after spaceflight, as well as increased expression of genes involved in these processes (\nSchatten et al., 2001\n; \nGridley et al., 2013\n, \n2015\n; \nNovoselova et al., 2015\n; \nBlaber et al., 2017\n). In contrast, the morphology of the submandibular gland appeared to be unaffected by either the 13-15 d or 30 d flights, and autophagic vacuoles and apoptotic cells were rare in both flight and ground control mice. The basis for the different responses seen in the parotid and submandibular gland is not known. However, the responses of the two glands to spaceflight parallel those seen in rats in experimental conditions such as feeding a liquid diet and streptozotocin diabetes, which result in increased autophagy and apoptosis in the parotid (\nHand and Ho, 1981\n; \nHand and Weiss, 1984\n; \nTakahashi et al., 2012\n), but few morphological changes in the submandibular gland (\nMednieks et al., 2009\n; \nTakahashi et al., 2014\n).\nIn conclusion, exposure to the spaceflight environment, and specifically microgravity, results in alterations in secretory protein expression in acinar and granular convoluted duct cells of the mouse submandibular gland. The effects appear to be related to the length of the spaceflight as they were seen after a 30 d flight but not after 13-15 d flights. They also may be influenced by the animal’s sex as they occurred in males but not females. Unlike the response of the parotid gland, no obvious changes in cell structure were observed in the submandibular gland. Our findings suggest that evaluating changes in the levels of specific proteins in saliva may be useful for monitoring astronaut physiology and health during long-term spaceflights.",
