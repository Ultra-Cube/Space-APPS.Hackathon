    "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient (\ndb\n/\ndb\n) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted with \ndb\n/\ndb\n bone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT). Gonadal AT in WT/db mice displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genes \nTnfa\n, \nIl6\n, and \nCcl2\n. In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity. Our findings establish a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine.",

    "results_and_discussion": "Effect of bone marrow leptin receptor deficiency on body weight and body composition\n\n\nWe generated bone marrow chimeric mice, reconstituted with either WT or \ndb\n/\ndb\n bone marrow, to investigate whether leptin signaling is involved in ATM recruitment and promotion of a proinflammatory condition in AT. We observed that WT/db mice experienced significantly less weight gain on HFD (\nFigure 1\n, A and B) and lower total adiposity (\nFigure 1\nC) compared with mice that received WT bone marrow. The lower adiposity in WT/db mice compared with WT/WT mice was driven by lower gWAT, inguinal WAT (iWAT), and retroperitoneal WAT mass in the former compared with the latter (\nFigure 1\nC). No difference was observed in brown AT. Both groups had equal food intake (\nFigure 1\nD). However, WT/db mice were considerably less energy-efficient than their WT/WT counterparts (\nFigure 1\nE). It is known that irradiation affects non–bone-marrow tissues, including AT (\n24\n, \n25\n). Furthermore, our data show that WT mice reconstituted with \ndb\n/\ndb\n bone marrow have even greater resistance to HFD-induced weight gain and adiposity than irradiated WT mice (WT/WT) on HFD. Therefore, leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells must play a role in body weight regulation in response to HFD, independently of its known role in preventing weight gain and fat mass accumulation (\n20\n). It has been suggested that reducing inflammation in AT could prevent weight gain associated with HFD feeding (\n26\n, \n27\n). However, attenuation of AT inflammation did not endow mice with the ability to resist weight gain and fatness in response to HFD (\n28\n–\n30\n). Therefore, reduced AT inflammation is unlikely to be the cause of the reduced body weight observed in WT/db mice. Although we did not investigate possible mechanisms underlying this surprising phenotype of HFD-fed WT/db mice, several factors might be involved. These include the inhibition of adipogenesis or differentiation of bone marrow-derived stem cells into adipocytes (\n31\n). In that regard, although WT/db mice had smaller gWAT, their average adipocyte size was larger than WT/WT (3.7 ± 1.2 vs 2.7 ± 0.6 μm\n2\n [×10\n3\n]) with fewer number of cells (25 ± 5 vs 32 ± 7 × 10\n3\n cells/cm\n2\n), suggesting a compromised adipogenesis. It is conceivable that leptin signaling may be involved in adipocyte recruitment into AT. Certainly, leptin and leptin receptor expression is vital for normal adipocyte commitment and maturation (\n32\n). It is also plausible that loss of bone density contributes to reduction in WT/db body weight gain compared with WT/WT mice. Our observation that WT/db mice experienced significantly less weight gain on HFD contrasts with the work of Gove et al (\n33\n). They found that chow-fed WT mice reconstituted with db/db or WT bone marrow exhibited similar body weight profiles 4 weeks after irradiation (\n33\n). In our study, WT/WT and WT/db mice on a normal-fat diet started showing a difference in body weight at 18 weeks after irradiation, although the difference was not significant (data not shown). At this point, we cannot rule out that the difference in body weight might have reached significance at later stages.\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nAnthropometric and food intake of WT/WT and WT/db mice on an HFD. A–C, WT male mice reconstituted with leptin receptor-deficient (WT/db) bone marrow gained significantly less weight at the end of a 16-week HFD challenge (A), with a significantly different cumulative weight gain (B) and significantly lower ratio adipose tissue pads to body weight (C) compared with controls (WT/WT). D and E, This occurred with no difference in food intake (D) and significantly different energy efficiency between groups (E). *, \nP\n < .05. Abbreviations: BAT, brown AT; rpWAT, retroperitoneal WAT.\nProinflammatory macrophage recruitment to AT\n\n\nObesity is associated with increased proinflammatory ATMs arranged in CLSs surrounding adipocytes. The high prevalence of CLS is highly correlated with AT inflammation and metabolic disorder (\n13\n). We observed significantly fewer CLSs in gWAT from WT/db HFD-fed mice compared with WT/WT HFD-fed mice (\nFigure 2\nA). Leptin induces mitogenesis (\n34\n), and to rule out that the decrease in CLS numbers was not secondary to an inhibition of mitosis, we measured the amount of macrophages in the SVF of both WT/WT and WT/db mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Both WT/WT and WT/db groups had similar total macrophage infiltration in their gWAT as measured by the percentage F4/80\n+\n/CD11b\n+\n cells in the SVF (33% and 10% of all SVF cells in gWAT and iWAT, respectively, in both groups, \nP\n > .05). However, although most ATMs in WT/WT mice were CCR2\n+\n, most ATMs in WT/db mice were MGL1\n+\n/CCR2\n−\n (\nFigure 2\nB). Anti-inflammatory macrophages secrete catecholamines inducing uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in AT (\n35\n). We report a prevalence of anti-inflammatory ATMs in WT/db mice, which might induce an increase in UCP1 and can explain the difference in body and fat mass weight. Although we did not measure UCP1, we believe that exploring this hypothesis is warranted in the future. Both the presence of CLSs and the expression of CCR2\n+\n ATMs correlate with AT inflammation (\n8\n, \n36\n). Moreover, leptin signaling deficiency in HFD-fed WT mice reconstituted with leptin receptor-null bone marrow resulted in greater than 2-fold reduction in the expression transcript levels for \nIl6\n and \nCcl2\n in gonadal fat and almost 2-fold for \nTnfa\n (\nTable 1\n), indicative of a proinflammatory environment. Conversely, the increased prevalence of MGL1\n+\n cells in WT/db AT compared with WT/WT AT (\nFigure 2\nB) is indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype of infiltrated macrophages. Although more than 80% of AT macrophages in gonadal and sc fat from lean mice are MGL1\n+\n, this value falls to 50% in obese mice, thus serving as a key determinant of pro- vs anti-inflammatory macrophage properties (\n9\n). We know that leptin is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes/macrophages in vitro (\n37\n, \n38\n) and induces a proinflammatory phenotype in T cells (\n39\n) and primes macrophages to secrete inflammatory cytokines under septic conditions (\n40\n). However, at this point, we cannot rule out that the difference in AT inflammation is secondary to reduced weight gain in WT/db mice. Future studies examining more detailed kinetic changes are warranted to address this issue. Nevertheless, our findings for the first time implicate leptin in the phenotypic switch of ATMs from anti-inflammatory (M2) to proinflammatory (M1) in vivo.\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nAdipose tissue inflammation.

No differences were observed in IL-6, TNF-α, or MCP-1 serum levels between the 2 experimental groups (data not shown). Paralleling fat mass data, leptin serum levels were lower in the WT/db mice compared with WT/WT with a borderline statistically significant difference between groups (\nP\n = .06, \nFigure 3\nA). Fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR index were measured to assess glucose metabolism. HOMA-IR is a predictor for insulin resistance in rodents (\n22\n). Fasting blood glucose was not different between the WT/WT and WT/db mice (\nFigure 3\nB). Both insulin and HOMA were lower in WT/db mice compared with WT/WT with insulin levels being statistically lower (\nP\n < .05) and HOMA-IR approaching statistical significance (\nP\n = .06) (\nFigure 3\n, C and D). These data suggest that WT HFD-fed mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow might be more insulin-sensitive compared with HFD-fed WT mice reconstituted with WT bone marrow. Although we used HOMA-IR to assess insulin resistance in this study, future studies measuring glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance are warranted to more conclusively assess glucose homeostasis in this model. It is probable that reduced AT inflammation in WT/db mice is the causal factor underlying the improved glucose homeostasis in these mice. The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, which in our study was close to 2-fold lower (mRNA) in WT/db AT compared with that of WT/WT mice (\nTable 1\n), directly contributes to insulin resistance through suppression of glucose transporter \nGLUT4\n gene expression (\n41\n) and induction of serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (\n42\n). The elevation of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α can also inhibit insulin signaling by activating Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) (\n43\n). CCL2 mRNA, which was reduced in AT of WT/db mice compared with WT/WT mice, is also directly involved in insulin function. CCL2 induces insulin resistance on adipocytes in an autocrine fashion by decreasing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (\n28\n, \n44\n). Our findings of reduced proinflammatory cytokine transcripts (\nTable 1\n) and reduced insulin levels (\nFigure 3\nB) in WT/db mice on an HFD support a role for leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived macrophage infiltration in obesity-associated insulin resistance. Many studies investigating ATM involvement in obesity-associated insulin resistance have used HFDs with a higher fat content (60%) (\n28\n, \n45\n) than the diet used (45% calories from fat) in this study. Perhaps the use of a more aggressive dietary approach would reveal more pronounced differences in the proinflammatory response to HFD between WT/WT and WT/db mice.\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nFasting serum levels of leptin and insulin and measures of HOMA-IR at 0, 8, and 16 weeks of HFD treatment.

Moreover, leptin signaling deficiency in HFD-fed WT mice reconstituted with leptin receptor-null bone marrow resulted in greater than 2-fold reduction in the expression transcript levels for \nIl6\n and \nCcl2\n in gonadal fat and almost 2-fold for \nTnfa\n (\nTable 1\n), indicative of a proinflammatory environment. Conversely, the increased prevalence of MGL1\n+\n cells in WT/db AT compared with WT/WT AT (\nFigure 2\nB) is indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype of infiltrated macrophages. Although more than 80% of AT macrophages in gonadal and sc fat from lean mice are MGL1\n+\n, this value falls to 50% in obese mice, thus serving as a key determinant of pro- vs anti-inflammatory macrophage properties (\n9\n). We know that leptin is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes/macrophages in vitro (\n37\n, \n38\n) and induces a proinflammatory phenotype in T cells (\n39\n) and primes macrophages to secrete inflammatory cytokines under septic conditions (\n40\n). However, at this point, we cannot rule out that the difference in AT inflammation is secondary to reduced weight gain in WT/db mice. Future studies examining more detailed kinetic changes are warranted to address this issue. Nevertheless, our findings for the first time implicate leptin in the phenotypic switch of ATMs from anti-inflammatory (M2) to proinflammatory (M1) in vivo.\nFigure 2.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nAdipose tissue inflammation.

    "effect_of_bone_marrow_leptin_receptor_deficiency_on_insulin_": "We measured fasting serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, leptin, insulin, and glucose in all mice at 0, 8, and 16 weeks of the study. No differences were observed in IL-6, TNF-α, or MCP-1 serum levels between the 2 experimental groups (data not shown). Paralleling fat mass data, leptin serum levels were lower in the WT/db mice compared with WT/WT with a borderline statistically significant difference between groups (\nP\n = .06, \nFigure 3\nA). Fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR index were measured to assess glucose metabolism. HOMA-IR is a predictor for insulin resistance in rodents (\n22\n). Fasting blood glucose was not different between the WT/WT and WT/db mice (\nFigure 3\nB). Both insulin and HOMA were lower in WT/db mice compared with WT/WT with insulin levels being statistically lower (\nP\n < .05) and HOMA-IR approaching statistical significance (\nP\n = .06) (\nFigure 3\n, C and D). These data suggest that WT HFD-fed mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow might be more insulin-sensitive compared with HFD-fed WT mice reconstituted with WT bone marrow. Although we used HOMA-IR to assess insulin resistance in this study, future studies measuring glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance are warranted to more conclusively assess glucose homeostasis in this model. It is probable that reduced AT inflammation in WT/db mice is the causal factor underlying the improved glucose homeostasis in these mice. The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, which in our study was close to 2-fold lower (mRNA) in WT/db AT compared with that of WT/WT mice (\nTable 1\n), directly contributes to insulin resistance through suppression of glucose transporter \nGLUT4\n gene expression (\n41\n) and induction of serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (\n42\n). The elevation of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α can also inhibit insulin signaling by activating Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) (\n43\n). CCL2 mRNA, which was reduced in AT of WT/db mice compared with WT/WT mice, is also directly involved in insulin function. CCL2 induces insulin resistance on adipocytes in an autocrine fashion by decreasing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (\n28\n, \n44\n). Our findings of reduced proinflammatory cytokine transcripts (\nTable 1\n) and reduced insulin levels (\nFigure 3\nB) in WT/db mice on an HFD support a role for leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived macrophage infiltration in obesity-associated insulin resistance. Many studies investigating ATM involvement in obesity-associated insulin resistance have used HFDs with a higher fat content (60%) (\n28\n, \n45\n) than the diet used (45% calories from fat) in this study. Perhaps the use of a more aggressive dietary approach would reveal more pronounced differences in the proinflammatory response to HFD between WT/WT and WT/db mice.\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nFasting serum levels of leptin and insulin and measures of HOMA-IR at 0, 8, and 16 weeks of HFD treatment.
