    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occurs in differentiating epithelial tissues, and cancers caused by the high-risk types (e.g., HPV16 and HPV18) typically occur at oropharyngeal and anogenital anatomical sites. The HPV life cycle is differentiation-dependent, requiring tissue culture methodology able to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) stratified epithelium. Here we report two distinct and complementary methods to grow differentiating epithelial tissues that mimic many critical morphological and biochemical aspects of \nin vivo\n tissue. The first approach involves growing primary human epithelial cells on top of a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen fibers and living fibroblast cells. When these cells are grown at the liquid-air interface, differentiation occurs and allows for epithelial stratification. The second approach uses a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The low-fluid-shear microgravity environment inside the bioreactor allows the cells to use collagen-coated microbeads as a growth scaffold and self assemble into 3D cellular aggregates. These approaches are applied to epithelial cells derived from HPV-positive and -negative oral and cervical tissues. The second part of the protocol introduces potential downstream applications for these 3D tissue models.\nWe describe methods that will allow readers to start successfully culturing 3D tissues from oral and cervical cells. These tissues have been used for microscopic visualization, scanning-electron microscopy, and large -omics studies to gain insights into epithelial biology, the HPV life cycle, and host-pathogen interactions.\nSupport Protocol 1: Isolation of epithelial cells from patient-derived tissues\nSupport Protocol 2: Growth and maintenance of primary human epithelial cells in monolayer culture\nSupport Protocol 3: PCR-based HPV screening of primary cell cultures\nBasic Protocol 1: Establishing human primary cell-derived 3D organotypic raft cultures\nSupport Protocol 4: Growth and maintenance of human A2EN cells as monolayer culture\nSupport Protocol 5: Preparing the slow turning lateral vessel bioreactor\nSupport Protocol 6: Preparing the cytodex-3 microcarrier beads\nBasic Protocol 2: Establishing human 3D cervical tissues using the rotating wall vessel bioreactor\nBasic Protocol 3: Histological assessment of 3D organotypic raft tissues\nBasic Protocol 4: Spatial analysis of protein expression in 3D organotypic raft cultures\nBasic Protocol 5: Immunofluorescent microscopy imaging of rotating wall vessel derived 3D tissues\nBasic Protocol 6: Ultrastructural visualization and imaging of rotating wall vessel derived 3D tissues\nSupport Protocol 7: RNA extraction from 3D tissues\nBasic Protocol 7: Characterization of gene expression by RT-qPCR\nKeywords:\n HPV, organotypic rafts, rotating wall vessel, bioreactor, 3D culture, cervix, oral, host-microbe interactions",
    "introduction": "Papillomaviruses are a diverse family of double-stranded DNA viruses with an epithelial tropism, infecting both cutaneous and mucosal epithelia of vertebrate hosts, including humans. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are ubiquitous infectious agents in human populations (\nSchiffman et al., 2016\n) and the most common sexually transmitted pathogen (\nSatterwhite et al., 2013\n). Oncogenic HPV infections are responsible for a staggering ~5% of human cancers (\nde Martel et al., 2020\n; \nZapatka et al., 2020\n). In addition to being responsible for virtually all cervical cancers, the incidence of HPV-associated oral cancers has dramatically increased during recent years (\nChaturvedi et al., 2011\n; \nMarur et al., 2010\n), making oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) the most common HPV-related malignancy in the United States (\nEisenberg et al., 2018\n). Of note, most HPV-positive OPSCCs arise in the tonsil crypts.\nFollowing the initial infection of basal cells, the HPV DNA is amplified and established as a low copy number extrachromosomal genome. Within these actively dividing cells, the HPV genome replicates alongside the host genome. As part of the cellular differentiation cycle, infected cells detach from the basement membrane and enter the suprabasal epithelial layer. Unlike uninfected cells, the expression of the viral E6 (\nDuffy et al., 2003\n; \nKranjec et al., 2017\n; \nMorgan et al., 2018\n) and E7 (\nBodily et al., 2011\n; \nFlores et al., 2000\n; \nMüller et al., 1999\n) proteins promotes unscheduled cell cycle progression, supporting continuous viral replication. As the cells continue to differentiate, increased expression of the E1 and E2 replication proteins leads to a transition towards productive viral DNA amplification (\nSakakibara et al., 2013\n). Finally, within the terminally differentiated layers of the epithelium, the viral capsid proteins (L1, \nBuck et al., 2013\n); and L2, \nWang & Roden, 2013\n) are synthesized, leading to virion assembly. This synchronized gene expression implies that the completion of the viral life cycle requires the three-dimensional stratified epithelium.\nKeratinocytes in the different strata of the differentiated tissue must coordinate their gene expression to fulfill specific and dynamic functions during cellular differentiation. At the stratum level, expression of many of the cellular genes are known, but how spatio-temporal gene expression is regulated is a topic of intense investigation (\nCavazza et al., 2016\n; \nFinnegan et al., 2019\n; \nJoost et al., 2016\n; \nKlein et al., 2017\n; \nLopez-Pajares et al., 2015\n; \nRubin et al., 2019\n). Modeling the physiologically relevant tissues will be critical to further our understanding of the viral life cycle.\nThe methods described in this protocol will outline two distinct and complementary approaches to reliably and reproducibly generate and characterize 3D tissues. By modeling the complexity of the full-thickness epithelium, these culture methods address a significant limitation of two-dimensional monolayer cultures. These culture models have been shown to faithfully recapitulate many morphological and physiological characteristics of tissue \nin vivo\n. These cultures not only preserve the cellular architecture of the cervical or tonsillar tissue but also respond to external stimuli in ways that mimic the response in the \nin vivo\n microenvironment (\nAsselineau & Prunieras, 1984\n; \nKopan et al., 1987\n; \nRadtke et al., 2012\n; \nRadtke & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012\n).\nWe provide methods to successfully isolate oral and cervical cells from donor-derived tissues, grow these cells into 3D epithelial tissues, and characterize them through a series of microscopic (histological, scanning electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence) and transcriptome-based analyses (\nFig. 1\n). Support Protocol 1 describes the isolation of primary epithelial cells (keratinocytes) from patient-derived tissues (e.g., cervical biopsies and tonsillectomies). These primary cultures are maintained as monolayers in \nSupport Protocol 2\n and screened for HPV DNA by PCR in \nSupport Protocol 3\n. \nBasic Protocols 1\n and \n2\n describe two distinct methods to generate 3D cultures: organotypic rafting or rotating wall vessel bioreactor. Cells and materials for Basic Protocol 2 are prepared using Support Protocol 4 (to grow and maintain cells) as well as Support Protocols 5 and 6 (to prepare the bioreactor and carrier beads used). An array of host differentiation and viral life cycle characterization techniques are detailed in \nBasic Protocol 3\n (histology), Basic Protocols 3 and 4 (immunofluorescence for raft tissues or rotating wall vessel tissues, respectively), Basic Protocol 6 (electron microscopy), and Support Protocol 7 (RNA extraction) coupled with Basic Protocol 7 (RT-qPCR).\nFigure 1.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nFlowchart of all protocols described in this protocol for preparing, culturing, and characterizing 3D oral and cervical tissue models for studying interactions between HPV and the infected host. The dotted line connecting Support Protocol 1 to Basic Protocol 2 indicates that, with proper optimization, it should be feasible to culture primary cells in the Rotating wall vessel bioreactor.\nBiosafety and ethics considerations\n\n\nCAUTION\n: Human tissues, cells, and HPV virions are a potential biohazard. Laboratory personnel should follow all biosafety and ethical guidelines relevant to local facilities, institutions, and governing bodies to properly acquire and handle donor-derived human samples that may contain pathogenic microorganisms. Appropriately trained individuals should conduct all work in accordance with your local guidelines and regulations. Human papillomavirus is considered a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) pathogen (\nDunne et al., 2014\n; \nHuman Papillomavirus Vaccination: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\n) and since 3D raft cultures are capable of producing infectious viral particles within the superficial layer (as virus-laden squames), BSL-2 precautions (e.g., personal protective equipment and using a biosafety cabinet) must be taken while handling cultures. In addition to good laboratory practice and aseptic technique, these precautions ensure reader safety and preserve the quality of results by limiting contamination.",

Cells should grow in individual colonies and should not contact neighboring colonies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove 10 cm plate of primary epithelial cells (e.g., human tonsillar keratinocytes, HTKs; or human cervical keratinocytes, HCKs) from the incubator and confirm by microscope that they are ready to harvest: sub-confluent, just before colonies start to touch.\n\n\nIf this is the first passage of the isolated cells it is important that you preserve their viability and make sufficient cryovial stocks. The majority of the cells harvested should be used for making these stocks, continued culturing, or for experiments or other molecular extractions. Only a small number of cells (< 10\n6\n) will be needed for DNA isolation.\n\n\n\n\nIn a biosafety cabinet, use a Pasteur pipette to vacuum aspirate the media from the cells, using the edge of the plate to avoid scraping the surface layer of cells.\n\n\n\n\nAdd 5 ml of Versene to the plate using a serological pipette, ensure full coverage by rocking back and forth and side-to-side, and incubate at room temperature for 1 min, then pipette the Versene up and down over the cells to help remove the feeder cells. Confirm by microscope that the feeders lift from the plate. It may be necessary to slightly agitate the plate by rocking back and forth, taking care not to spill the contents.\n\n\nVersene will cause the J2 fibroblast feeder cells to detach whilst leaving the keratinocytes adhered.\n\n\n\n\nVacuum aspirate the Versene and suspended J2 feeder cells.\n\n\nRinse the cells in 5 ml D-PBS to help remove any residual J2 feeder cells.\n\n\nVacuum aspirate the D-PBS and any residual feeder cells.\n\n\nAdd 3 ml of 37°C 0.25% trypsin/EDTA, ensure full coverage of the surface of the plate by rocking back and forth and side-to-side, and incubate at 37°C until keratinocyte colonies are dissociated and detached from the plate (~5 to 10 min). Check by microscope often to ensure cells do not remain in trypsin longer than necessary.\n\n\nAdd 7 ml of F-media to inactivate the trypsin, pipette up/down, rinsing the plate, to create a cell suspension, and transfer this 10 ml total volume to a 50 ml conical tube. These cells can be counted, to determine the number of cells per ml, and used in downstream protocols (for seeding the basal keratinocyte layer in \nBasic Protocol 1\n; for PCR-based HPV screening in \nSupport Protocol 3\n; and as a 2D monolayer control for RNA extraction in \nSupport Protocol 7\n and RT-qPCR in \nBasic Protocol 7\n).",

Attach the STLV bioreactor to the rotator unit housed inside a 37°C incubator. Turn on the power and adjust the rotational speed to 20 rpm.\n\n\n5. Allow the STLV bioreactor to incubate at 37°C, 20 rpm for three days without changing the culture medium. Remove bubbles daily to maximize cell attachment to microcarrier beads and minimize disruption of 3D cellular aggregate formation.\n\n\n6. On the \nfourth day of incubation\n, replace the spent culture medium from the STLV bioreactor.\n\n\n\nOpen the stop cocks and remove both syringe plungers.\n\n\nTilt the STLV bioreactor so the 10 ml syringe side is at an ~45° angle and allow the 3D cell aggregates to settle in the corner.\n\n\nUse a sterile 10 ml serological pipette attached to an automatic pipettor, to slowly aspirate and discard 40 ml of the spent culture medium. Avoid removing the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Unpackage new 5 ml and 10 ml syringes. Remove plungers and resleeve in their plastic wrapper to maintain sterility. Replace old syringes with new syringes.\n\n\n8. Fill STLV bioreactor with fresh, prewarmed complete KFSM medium, as outlined in \nsteps 4–5 above\n.\n\n\n\n\n9. Reattach the STLV bioreactor to the rotating unit and resume incubation at 37°C, 20 rpm.\n\n\n\nThe bioreactor must be incubated with continuous rotation, except when replacing culture medium and transferring 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to the disposable HARV.\n\n\n\n\n10. Replace the culture medium every other day until day 10; after day 10, replace culture medium daily until day 28 of incubation.\n\n\n11. Monitor development of the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates on a weekly basis by removing ~0.2 ml of resuspended A2EN cellular aggregates from the central port using a wide-bore 1000 μl pipette tip. Place 3D A2EN cellular aggregates in a small petri dish containing 0.5–1 ml of medium and visualize using an inverted light microscope.\n\n\n12. After 21 days of incubation in the STLV bioreactor, unpackage a sterile disposable HARV bioreactor and remove the central plug.\n\n\n12. Decontaminate the STLV surface with 70% ethanol and dry thoroughly.\n\n\n13. Aspirate and discard 30 ml of spent culture medium from the STLV bioreactor.\n\n\n14. Remove the central port plug and gently swirl the STLV bioreactor to resuspend the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates.\n\n\n15. Carefully pour the mixture into a sterile 50 ml conical tube. Allow the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle.\n\n\n16. Aspirate and discard ~10 ml of the upper supernatant layer. Gently swirl the 50 ml conical tube to resuspend the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates.\n\n\n17. Using a wide-bore 1000 μl pipette, carefully transfer the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates into the disposable HARV bioreactor through the central port.\n\n\n18. Collect residual 3D A2EN cellular aggregates by rinsing the 50 ml conical tube walls with 10 ml of fresh prewarmed complete KFSM medium. Transfer residual 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to the HARV bioreactor and replace the central plug.\n\n\n\n\n19. Unpackage new 5 ml and 10 ml syringes and remove plungers. Resleeve plungers in their plastic wrappers to maintain sterility. Attach syringes to the disposable HARV built-in stop cocks. Fill with prewarmed complete KFSM medium, as outlined in \nsteps 4–5 above\n.\n\n\n\nIt is important to ensure all bubbles are removed from the medium within the STLV to avoid mechanical shearing of the cells from the bead surface and to promote 3D A2EN cellular aggregate formation.\n\n\n\n\n20. Attach the disposable HARV bioreactor to the rotator unit and incubate at 37°C, 20 rpm for 7 additional days. Replace medium daily, as outlined in \nstep 4–5 above\n.\n\n\n21. The 3D human A2EN cellular aggregates are ready to harvest for downstream experimentation on day 28 of incubation.\n\n\n22. Remove syringe plungers and aspirate and discard ~30 ml of culture medium. Remove the central port from the HARV bioreactor, gently swirl to resuspend the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates, and carefully pour mixture into a sterile 50 ml conical tube.\n\n\n23. Allow 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle. Aspirate 10 ml of the top layer of culture medium and add to the disposable HARV bioreactor.\n\n\n24. Gently swirl the disposable HARV to collect residual 3D A2EN cellular aggregates and carefully pour into the 50 ml conical tube to pool the samples.\n\n\n25. Allow the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle.\n\n\n\n\n26. Aspirate and discard the top layer of culture medium.\n\n\n\nPerform all remaining steps with KFSM medium without Primocin added.\n\n\n\n\n27. Wash 3D A2EN cellular aggregates with 15 ml of KFSM medium without Primocin. Gently swirl tube to ensure 3D A2EN aggregates are thoroughly washed. Allow 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle.\n\n\n28. Aspirate and discard the upper layer of medium. Repeat rinse with ~40 ml of KFSM medium lacking Primocin. Allow 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle.\n\n\n\n\n29. Swirl 50 ml conical tube to thoroughly resuspend 3D A2EN cellular aggregates. Using a wide-bore 1000 μl pipette tip, aliquot 1 ml samples into a sterile 24-well tissue-treated culture plate.\n\n\n\nIt is important to thoroughly resuspend 3D cellular aggregates before each 1 ml aliquot to ensure 3D A2EN cellular aggregates are evenly partitioned amongst the 24-well plate.\n\n\n\n\n30. Halfway through the aliquot process (after transferring to 18 wells), transfer 1 ml of 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube for enumerating 3D A2EN cells by trypan blue exclusion.\n\n\n31. Incubate the 1.5 ml microfuge tube containing 3D A2EN cellular aggregates at 37°C and continue aliquoting 3D A2EN cellular aggregates into the remaining wells of both 24-well plates. When complete, incubate both 24-well plates at 37°C, 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n32. The 3D A2EN cellular aggregates are now ready to be used for downstream assays.\n\n\n33. To count the cells, aspirate and discard the upper layer of culture medium from the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 3D A2EN cellular aggregates from \nstep 30\n. Avoid transferring the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates. Wash the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates with 1 ml of sterile D-PBS pre-warmed to 37°C. Allow the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle.\n\n\n34. Aspirate and discard the upper layer of D-PBS, being careful not to remove the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates.\n\n\n\n\n35. Treat the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates with 300 μl of pre-warmed trypsin-EDTA to dissociate the 3D A2EN cells from the microcarrier bead matrix. Invert the tube several times to mix thoroughly. Incubate the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates at 37°C for 10 minutes with periodic inversion to promote detachment.\n\n\n\nThe beads will progressively look like “particles of sand” as the 3D A2EN cells dissociate from the microcarrier beads with continued incubation in the trypsin-EDTA solution.\n\n\n\n\n36. Add pre-warmed neutralization medium to the 1.5 ml microfuge tube to the 1 ml gradient line (~500–600 μl). Mix thoroughly by inverting the tube several times. Allow the microcarrier beads to settle.\n\n\n37. Aspirate 10 μl of the A2EN cell-containing supernatant into a sterile 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 10 μl of 0.4% trypan blue solution and gently mix by pipetting. Enumerate viable cells using an automated cell counter (e.g., Invitrogen Countess) or manually using a hemocytometer, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\n\n38. Utilize 3D A2EN cellular aggregates incubating in the 24-well plates for downstream experimental analysis.\n\n\n\n\nA workflow diagram for generating 3D A2EN cells is shown in \nFig. 4\n.\n\n\nFigure 4.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nWorkflow diagram for generating 3D A2EN cells using RWV bioreactor technology.

    "basic_protocol_3:_histological_assessment_of_3d_organotypic_": "The methods outlined in \nBasic Protocol 1\n aim to generate tissues that accurately represent the original tissue. Routine histological assessment on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections usually involves staining with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. This allows for visualization of organotypic cultures. Comparison with known tissues, e.g., through the Human Protein Atlas (\nhttp://www.proteinatlas.org\n, see the Normal Tissue Histology section of the Dictionary; \nUhlén et al., 2005\n), will allow for comparison between the organotypic tissues and their \nin vivo\n counterparts. Finally, histological assessment can be the first step in observing any morphological changes related to your experiment.\nMethods for tissue embedding, sectioning, and H&E staining are beyond the scope of this protocol. We provide details on methods that will allow the reader to identify epithelial strata in their cultures, compare these structures to genuine tissues, and ultimately determine the success of their raft cultures.\nMaterials\n\n\nH&E stained slides with permanently mounted coverslip (rafts should be cut in half, bisected, and embedded so that the open faces are orientated to allow a cross-sectional view of the epithelium, 4 μm thickness, two sections per slide)\n\n\nMicroscope with color camera\nProtocol Steps\n\n\n\n\nObserve the entire epithelium for each tissue piece for histological features.\n\n\nEnsure that the two major compartments are present: dermis (or stroma) and epidermis (or epithelium, proper).\n\n\n\nThe dermis should appear light pink (eosin-stained collagen fibers) with sporadic dark purple/blue, haematoxylin-stained fibroblast nuclei.\n\n\nObserve the clear distinction between the dermal compartment and the epidermis (darker pink, more nuclei, stratified keratinocytes).\n\n\n\n\nThe epidermis of full-thickness stratified squamous epithelium should consist of a basal layer of proliferating keratinocytes (\nstratum basale\n), with a basement membrane dividing this layer from the dermis. Cells above the basal layer are referred to as “suprabasal” and comprise several strata making up an intermediate “midzone” and then at the top a “superficial” layer. The cells immediately above the basal layer are referred to as “parabasal”, whereas the majority of midzone cells make up the \nstratum spinosum\n. Above the spinous layer is a thin granular layer (\nstratum granulosum\n) and then the \nstratum lucidum\n and finally the \nstratum corneum\n (which is predominantly present in keratinizing epithelia, like cutaneous skin, making up the uppermost and most differentiated superficial cells, and absent or only partially present in non-keratinizing mucosal epithelia, like tonsillar or ectocervical tissue.\n\n\n\nOccasionally upper layers of the epidermis, or even the entire epidermis itself, can detach during raft harvesting or tissue processing. These pieces may still be stained and observable, so if you see only dermis in the main tissue piece make sure you look around the area (at low magnification, like 10x) to see if the epidermal compartment is nearby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample histology data are shown in \nFig. 5\n.\n\n\nFigure 5.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\nHistological microscope images of 3D organotypic epithelia.

    "basic_protocol_4:_spatial_analysis_of_protein_expression_in_": "While H&E stained tissues provide a general idea of the histological features of these 3D cultures (Basic Protocol 3), this stain does not provide data on specific proteins that have unique expression patterns between different tissues, spatially according to the differentiation state of the tissue, or dysregulated as a result of viral activities. This protocol provides methods to characterize target proteins in 3D raft tissue using immunofluorescence on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. The conditions used here work for detecting differentiation (e.g., keratins) and viral life cycle related markers (e.g., dysregulated cell cycle proteins, such as p16), but the reader should keep in mind that conditions (e.g., as antigen-retrieval, blocking buffer composition, and antibody dilutions) may need to be optimized for a specific target of interests.\nMaterials\n\n\nReagents, solutions, and cell lines\n\n\n\n\nFormalin-fixed paraffin embedded unstained tissue sections on microscope slides\n\n\nXylenes\n\n\n100% EtOH\n\n\n10mM Citrate buffer pH 6 (or, alternatively, optimal antigen-retrieval buffer)\n\n\n1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS, from 10x stock, see recipe)\n\n\nBovine serum albumin (Bioworld, cat. no. 22070023–2)\n\n\n2% BSA/PBS block or equivalent\n\n\nTween-20 (Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

    "commentary": "BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\n\nThe papillomavirus life cycle is intricately linked to the differentiation status of the infected tissue and cells. Therefore, the complex papillomavirus replicative cycle has been difficult to recapitulate in the laboratory. To decipher the fundamental biology of HPVs, it is essential to recapitulate the 3D structure of these tissues. Furthermore, epidemiological data strongly suggest that the nature of the infected tissue (i.e., cervix or tonsillar crypts) plays a critical role in how HPV interacts with the host (\nDoorbar & Griffin, 2019\n; \nRoberts et al., 2019\n). This protocol provides complementary methods to establish 3D organotypic tissues representing cervical and oral epithelia. Unlike conventional monolayer cultures, both organotypic raft cultures and RWV-derived human 3D tissues recapitulate physiological architecture, such as apical and basal cell polarity, and ultrastructural features (\nAsselineau & Prunieras, 1984\n; \nKopan et al., 1987\n; \nRadtke et al., 2012\n; \nRadtke & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012\n).\n\n\nOrganotypic raft cultures (named due to the apparent floating nature of the cell-matrix) have been critical in deciphering different aspects of the HPV life cycle. These methods were initially developed to study skin biology and skin grafting research (\nBell et al., 1983\n; \nRheinwald & Green, 1975a\n), and were later adapted to study HPV. The complete life cycle of a human papillomavirus (HPV) was first elucidated in this culture system (\nDollard et al., 1992\n; \nMcCance et al., 1988\n; \nMeyers et al., 1992\n). In addition to the current protocol, other, excellent organotypic raft protocols have been published and used (\nAnacker & Moody, 2012\n; \nLambert et al., 2005\n; \nLee et al., 2016\n; \nOzbun & Patterson, 2014\n; \nRoberts et al., 2019\n). The ability to establish these 3D organotypic raft cultures from diverse human tissues will allow researchers to study how HPV (or other pathogens) interact with these physiologically relevant tissues. Indeed, we demonstrate that once isolated, these cells maintain properties reminiscent of the initial tissue.\n\n\nThe rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology was developed by NASA in the 1990’s to study the impact of low fluid-shear modeled microgravity environment and this methodology was found to promote cellular differentiation and faithfully recapitulate features of human tissue (\nUnsworth & Lelkes, 1998\n). Cells are cultured with microcarrier beads providing an extracellular matrix for cells to attach within the low fluid-shear environment using RWV bioreactor thereby promoting cellular differentiation and formation of 3D tissue aggregates (\nGardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016\n). This culture methodology has been utilized to generate organotypic epithelial tissues from a wide variety of sites that recapitulate the \nin vivo\n architecture, barrier function, secretion of mucins, apical-basolateral polarity and transcriptional programs of \nin vivo\n tissue as reviewed extensively (\nBarrila et al., 2010\n; \nGardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016\n). Furthermore, the 3D RWV-derived organotypic tissues have also been utilized to study a plethora of host-microbe interactions, including throughout the female reproductive tract (\nBarrila et al., 2010\n, \n2018\n; \nCrabbé et al., 2017\n; \nDrummond et al., 2016\n; \nGardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016\n, \n2018\n; \nHerbst-Kralovetz et al., 2016\n; \nIlhan et al., 2020\n; \nŁaniewski et al., 2017\n; \nNickerson et al., 2001\n; \nSainz et al., 2009\n). It is becoming increasingly clear that 3D RVW-derived organoids provide researchers with advanced \nin vitro\n model systems that better resemble human \nin vivo\n tissue equivalents and are desirable when suitable animal models of infection are lacking or to complement other existing model systems.\n\n\nThere is currently no animal model that adequately mimics the human \nLactobacillus-\ndominated cervicovaginal microenvironment (\nHerbst-Kralovetz et al., 2016\n; \nWitkin & Ledger, 2012\n). Human cervical and vaginal lines derived from explanted tissues suffer from a finite life span and conventional 2D monolayer cultures fail to exhibit features of their parental \nin vivo\n tissue. The 3D RWV-derived A2EN cervical cells, on the other hand, faithfully recapitulate cellular phenotypes of \nin vivo\n tissue, such as apical and basal cellular polarity, microvilli, mucin secretion, and intracellular tight junctions (\nRadtke et al., 2012\n; \nRadtke & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012\n). Human A2EN cervical cells are immortalized by stable transfection with the HPV E6 and E7 proteins, therefore providing long-term replicative capacity (\nHerbst-Kralovetz et al., 2008\n). Additionally, 3D A2EN cervical models have been colonized effectively with \nLactobacillus\n spp. and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria, exposed to microbial products and challenged with pathogens and found to recapitulate clinical features of the cervicovaginal microenvironment (\nGardner et al., 2020\n; \nMcGowin et al., 2013\n; \nRadtke et al., 2012\n; \nWinkle et al., 2016\n). Therefore, 3D RWV-derived cervical cell models described in these protocols may allow researchers to study how genital bacteria and pathogens of the cervicovaginal microenvironment influence the HPV lifecycle.\n\n\nIn conclusion, we provide detailed protocols on establishing and analyzing 3D tissues to study the interactions between HPV and its specific host tissues.\nCRITICAL PARAMETERS\n\n\nA successful 3D organotypic raft culture experiment requires healthy, proliferative cells. Furthermore, it is critical that researchers adhere to the stepwise process of building and lifting the rafts. Finally, these raft tissues are fragile, and careful handling throughout is essential. Both the fibroblasts and keratinocytes need to be viable to function properly for the duration of the raft procedure and should be proliferative without showing signs of senescence or transformation prior to initiating rafts. It is also critical that the appropriate media are used during each step of the procedure: EGF-containing F-media (with or without ROCK inhibition) when the basal keratinocytes are seeded. A switch to differentiation media (calcium-supplemented, without EGF and no ROCK inhibitor) is made once the tissues are lifted to the air-liquid interface. Each step of the raft process requires careful handling. When seeding the dermal equivalents you must work quickly, before the collagen-mixture solidifies, while avoiding the introduction of air bubbles. When lifting the rafts onto membranes you must take care not to break, drop, or place the cultures upside down.\n\n\nWith regard to the 3D RWV bioreactor-derived model system one should consider the initial set up cost of purchase the RWV bioreactor system (RLSS-4, power source, etc) and the time investment to generate fully differentiated 3D aggregates (28 days). The most critical parameters include the preparation of the beads and bioreactor, growth and health of the cells and appropriate seeding of the bioreactor. Additional parameters include close monitoring and maintenance of cells over the 28 day period. Bioreactors require media to be changed daily after a point in the protocol when the cells are consuming the nutrients as indicated by a color change in media. Following media changes, one must ensure that there are no bubbles in the bioreactor. These bubbles are removed carefully from the ports and the elimination of these bubbles are extremely important for aggregate formation.

    "background_information": "The papillomavirus life cycle is intricately linked to the differentiation status of the infected tissue and cells. Therefore, the complex papillomavirus replicative cycle has been difficult to recapitulate in the laboratory. To decipher the fundamental biology of HPVs, it is essential to recapitulate the 3D structure of these tissues. Furthermore, epidemiological data strongly suggest that the nature of the infected tissue (i.e., cervix or tonsillar crypts) plays a critical role in how HPV interacts with the host (\nDoorbar & Griffin, 2019\n; \nRoberts et al., 2019\n). This protocol provides complementary methods to establish 3D organotypic tissues representing cervical and oral epithelia. Unlike conventional monolayer cultures, both organotypic raft cultures and RWV-derived human 3D tissues recapitulate physiological architecture, such as apical and basal cell polarity, and ultrastructural features (\nAsselineau & Prunieras, 1984\n; \nKopan et al., 1987\n; \nRadtke et al., 2012\n; \nRadtke & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012\n).\nOrganotypic raft cultures (named due to the apparent floating nature of the cell-matrix) have been critical in deciphering different aspects of the HPV life cycle. These methods were initially developed to study skin biology and skin grafting research (\nBell et al., 1983\n; \nRheinwald & Green, 1975a\n), and were later adapted to study HPV. The complete life cycle of a human papillomavirus (HPV) was first elucidated in this culture system (\nDollard et al., 1992\n; \nMcCance et al., 1988\n; \nMeyers et al., 1992\n). In addition to the current protocol, other, excellent organotypic raft protocols have been published and used (\nAnacker & Moody, 2012\n; \nLambert et al., 2005\n; \nLee et al., 2016\n; \nOzbun & Patterson, 2014\n; \nRoberts et al., 2019\n). The ability to establish these 3D organotypic raft cultures from diverse human tissues will allow researchers to study how HPV (or other pathogens) interact with these physiologically relevant tissues. Indeed, we demonstrate that once isolated, these cells maintain properties reminiscent of the initial tissue.\nThe rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology was developed by NASA in the 1990’s to study the impact of low fluid-shear modeled microgravity environment and this methodology was found to promote cellular differentiation and faithfully recapitulate features of human tissue (\nUnsworth & Lelkes, 1998\n). Cells are cultured with microcarrier beads providing an extracellular matrix for cells to attach within the low fluid-shear environment using RWV bioreactor thereby promoting cellular differentiation and formation of 3D tissue aggregates (\nGardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016\n). This culture methodology has been utilized to generate organotypic epithelial tissues from a wide variety of sites that recapitulate the \nin vivo\n architecture, barrier function, secretion of mucins, apical-basolateral polarity and transcriptional programs of \nin vivo\n tissue as reviewed extensively (\nBarrila et al., 2010\n; \nGardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016\n). Furthermore, the 3D RWV-derived organotypic tissues have also been utilized to study a plethora of host-microbe interactions, including throughout the female reproductive tract (\nBarrila et al., 2010\n, \n2018\n; \nCrabbé et al., 2017\n; \nDrummond et al., 2016\n; \nGardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016\n, \n2018\n; \nHerbst-Kralovetz et al., 2016\n; \nIlhan et al., 2020\n; \nŁaniewski et al., 2017\n; \nNickerson et al., 2001\n; \nSainz et al., 2009\n). It is becoming increasingly clear that 3D RVW-derived organoids provide researchers with advanced \nin vitro\n model systems that better resemble human \nin vivo\n tissue equivalents and are desirable when suitable animal models of infection are lacking or to complement other existing model systems.\nThere is currently no animal model that adequately mimics the human \nLactobacillus-\ndominated cervicovaginal microenvironment (\nHerbst-Kralovetz et al., 2016\n; \nWitkin & Ledger, 2012\n). Human cervical and vaginal lines derived from explanted tissues suffer from a finite life span and conventional 2D monolayer cultures fail to exhibit features of their parental \nin vivo\n tissue. The 3D RWV-derived A2EN cervical cells, on the other hand, faithfully recapitulate cellular phenotypes of \nin vivo\n tissue, such as apical and basal cellular polarity, microvilli, mucin secretion, and intracellular tight junctions (\nRadtke et al., 2012\n; \nRadtke & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012\n). Human A2EN cervical cells are immortalized by stable transfection with the HPV E6 and E7 proteins, therefore providing long-term replicative capacity (\nHerbst-Kralovetz et al., 2008\n). Additionally, 3D A2EN cervical models have been colonized effectively with \nLactobacillus\n spp. and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria, exposed to microbial products and challenged with pathogens and found to recapitulate clinical features of the cervicovaginal microenvironment (\nGardner et al., 2020\n; \nMcGowin et al., 2013\n; \nRadtke et al., 2012\n; \nWinkle et al., 2016\n). Therefore, 3D RWV-derived cervical cell models described in these protocols may allow researchers to study how genital bacteria and pathogens of the cervicovaginal microenvironment influence the HPV lifecycle.\nIn conclusion, we provide detailed protocols on establishing and analyzing 3D tissues to study the interactions between HPV and its specific host tissues.",
    "critical_parameters": "A successful 3D organotypic raft culture experiment requires healthy, proliferative cells. Furthermore, it is critical that researchers adhere to the stepwise process of building and lifting the rafts. Finally, these raft tissues are fragile, and careful handling throughout is essential. Both the fibroblasts and keratinocytes need to be viable to function properly for the duration of the raft procedure and should be proliferative without showing signs of senescence or transformation prior to initiating rafts. It is also critical that the appropriate media are used during each step of the procedure: EGF-containing F-media (with or without ROCK inhibition) when the basal keratinocytes are seeded. A switch to differentiation media (calcium-supplemented, without EGF and no ROCK inhibitor) is made once the tissues are lifted to the air-liquid interface. Each step of the raft process requires careful handling. When seeding the dermal equivalents you must work quickly, before the collagen-mixture solidifies, while avoiding the introduction of air bubbles. When lifting the rafts onto membranes you must take care not to break, drop, or place the cultures upside down.\nWith regard to the 3D RWV bioreactor-derived model system one should consider the initial set up cost of purchase the RWV bioreactor system (RLSS-4, power source, etc) and the time investment to generate fully differentiated 3D aggregates (28 days). The most critical parameters include the preparation of the beads and bioreactor, growth and health of the cells and appropriate seeding of the bioreactor. Additional parameters include close monitoring and maintenance of cells over the 28 day period. Bioreactors require media to be changed daily after a point in the protocol when the cells are consuming the nutrients as indicated by a color change in media. Following media changes, one must ensure that there are no bubbles in the bioreactor. These bubbles are removed carefully from the ports and the elimination of these bubbles are extremely important for aggregate formation. In addition, the rotation must be maintained 24 hours a day except for when changing the media. Failure to turn the rotator back, prior to differentiation and harvest, will result in a ruined batch of aggregates.",
