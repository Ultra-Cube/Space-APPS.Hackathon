Therefore, we had to design and validate flight hardware for MME. MME provides a contemporary example of many of the challenges faced by researchers conducting <bold><italic>C. elegans</italic></bold> experiments onboard the International Space Station. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation, in addition to the ground-based experiment scientific validation testing.

Spaceflight is associated with deconditioning of multiple bodily systems, including the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems (Demontis <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Strollo <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Physiological decline occurs despite participation in exercise countermeasures, which are a potent stimulus to promote musculoskeletal and cardiovascular adaptation (Trappe <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and optimal immune function (Simpson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) on Earth. While vestibular adaptations take place in the first days after transition to the microgravity environment, decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems can worsen with missions of greater duration (Fitts <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Strollo <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), potentially limiting our capacity for interplanetary missions such as to Mars (Gaffney <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>These challenges have motivated research around strategies to prevent this (mal)adaptation in space. As the precise molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced physiological deconditioning have not been identified, this limits our ability to design molecularly rationalized countermeasures.</p><p>Biological experiments in space can, however, be methodologically challenging. Although the United States has designated the US segment of the International Space Station (ISS) as a National Laboratory, experiments are not routinely carried out by using standardized equipment or methods that are in common use in other laboratories on Earth. Size, power, mass, late access for experiment integration onto the rocket, and ability to oversee the experiment remain challenges, despite more than 40 years of conducting biology experiments in space. Thus, the development of hardware and the validation of experimental conditions remain critical in the acquisition of quality data that can ultimately promote understanding of biological changes in space that should underpin rationale countermeasures to physiological changes in space.</p><p>Our current experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME), uses the model organism, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, to explore the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is an established model organism for studies on Earth (Kaletta and Hengartner, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Corsi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and in space (Szewczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Higashitani <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Honda <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, 2014; Higashibata <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>In the context of very limited access to space, the short life span and microscopic size of <italic>C. elegans</italic> enable data to be collected across the entire life span (Gaffney <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>) in high <italic>n</italic> numbers and replicates to generate robust data rapidly. The operational requirements of MME include many that apply to biological payloads across species (<italic>e.g.</italic>, late access, temperature-controlled upload/download, and time critical astronaut interventions). MME is therefore a generalizable example of many of the challenges in conducting contemporary astrobiology research onboard the ISS.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> have been studied in space for more than 20 years by using a variety of spaceflight hardware configurations (Ishioka and Higashibata, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). With the exception of STS-107 (Szewczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), all past flights involved in the study of <italic>C. elegans</italic> have used nonstandard laboratory hardware. It is therefore not surprising that <italic>C. elegans</italic> spaceflight experiments can fail due to lack of sufficient oxygen to support the worms (Warren <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), a problem that can be dealt with through preflight ground testing. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation in addition to the ground-based experiment sequence validation testing for MME.</p><p>The first key challenge was overcoming the difficulty of growing worms inside plastic bags. The second key challenge was working out timings to allow upload to the ISS using passive temperature control. These studies should allow other researchers to replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s002"><title>2.&#x02002;Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>2.1.&#x02002;Nematode and bacteria preparation</title><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> strain PD55 (<italic>ccIs55</italic> (<italic>unc-54::lacZ</italic>) V) was used for development and testing phases of this study.

Therefore, we tested the biocompatibility of three different bag materials: (i) polyethylene (PE) bags (1.5 inch, 250 gauge, Lay Flat Polythene Tubing; Kite Packaging Ltd., United Kingdom), (ii) Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) PE bags (Nipro, Japan), and (iii) fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) bags (Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics; TOSS GmbH, Germany). The PE bags and FEP bags are low friction and allow good gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, although gas exchange is reported to be superior in FEP to PE in bags of equal thickness (NB. all bags have previously supported <italic>C. elegans</italic> cultures in spaceflight experiments onboard the ISS).</p><p>The JAXA bags are a proprietary PE blend that is no longer commercially available. To test the bags, 5000 L1 larvae were placed in the bag with OP50 before bags were heat sealed (Pacseal<sup>+</sup> impulse heat sealer; Rajapack, United Kingdom), and then, the worms were cultured for 7 days at 20&#x000b0;C. After 7 days, the total worm population in each bag was counted. Three biological replicates were carried out per condition. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out in GraphPad Prism to compare the populations of worms in the three bags.</p></sec><sec id="s005"><title>2.3.&#x02002;Oxygen consumption rates</title><p>To investigate whether diet influenced changes in oxygen consumption rates (OCR), measurements were carried out with the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), as previously described (Hewitt <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Koopman <italic>et al.,</italic>
<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).

Stable OCR measurements were taken by performing five measurement cycles for basal OCR, nine cycles for maximal OCR following the addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M final well concentration), and five cycles for nonmitochondrial OCR following the addition of sodium azide (40&#x02009;nM final well concentration).</p><p>OCR measurements were normalized to the number of worms per well. To obtain stable OCR measurements, the final three, seven, and two measurement cycles were used for the statistical analysis of basal, maximal, and nonmitochondrial OCR, respectively, as previously described (Hewitt <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Differences in OCR were detected with a one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism 8 (La Jolla, CA).

Once complete, the population of viable worms in the bags were counted under a dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ645; Nikon, Japan) and compared against control bags that were otherwise identical except were located outside the EC.</p><p>Two different cage inserts for the ECs were designed and tested to maintain separation between the bags during the turbulent upload phase of launch, to maintain a surface area for gas exchange in flight, and to prevent the bags from freezing together at the end of the experiment. To test which cage design was best, worms were grown in bags alone, in cage design 1, and in cage design 2. Upon selection of cage design 2, further testing was carried out by growing worms in bags alone, in cage 2 alone, and in cage 2 inside an EC.

To test this, we obtained upload times from handover to installation on the ISS from NASA cold stowage for previous SpaceX launches (<xref rid="tb1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), as well as data for the performance of 10&#x000b0;C and 12&#x000b0;C ICE Bricks passive upload cold stowage phase change material over upload to ISS time frames.</p><table-wrap id="tb1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Duration from Launch: 26 H Turnover to NASA Cold Stowage Until Installation on the International Space Station</p></caption><!--OASIS TABLE HERE--><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Mission</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Handover to installation, h</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SpX-4</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">130</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SpX-5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">97</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SpX-6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">137</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SpX-8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">91</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SpX-9</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">105</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SpX-10</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">152</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SpX-11</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">138</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SpX-12</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">90</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SpX-13</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">94</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SpX-14</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">94</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Using these data, we loaded 5000 L1 larvae into 6&#x02009;mL of freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal into the bags inside the full EC setup (including the cage insert) and tested various upload scenarios. Following upload scenario testing, we ran the full experiment simulating a scheduled launch, a 24&#x02009;h delay, and a 48&#x02009;h delay. Following these simulations, the total worm populations were counted and compared with the nominal (on-time) launch scenario. A nominal launch scenario is associated with the generation of &#x0003e;45,000 worms per bag, which is the requirement for postflight analysis. To determine whether our experimental design could withstand a 24 or 48&#x02009;h delay, we set a matched population threshold of &#x0003e;45,000 worms per bag at the end of the experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s009"><title>3.&#x02002;Results</title><sec id="s010"><title>3.1.&#x02002;Evaluation and selection of culture bags</title><p>Several previous spaceflight experiments have grown worms in liquid culture inside plastic experimental bags (Selch <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Szewczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Higashitani <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>); in some cases, worms were grown with an OP50 diet, in others with a CeMM diet.

Since both past reports of use of FEP involved growing worms in CeMM rather than the OP50 diet used in MME, we were curious if the failure to grow was due to the food source. Worms grown in CeMM take longer to develop, have longer life expectancies, exhibit altered gene expression, and exhibit the characteristics of dietary restriction (Szewczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the physiological and gene expression changes in CeMM-grown worms, we hypothesized that worms grown in CeMM have differences in metabolism compared with those grown in OP50.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, worms grown in CeMM have significantly lower basal levels of oxygen consumption. This suggests that OP50-grown worms could have been limited for oxygen inside the FEP bags, whereas the CeMM grown worms were not.

Thus, for the timelines/late handover scenario associated with a Dragon launch scenario, similar to ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), we would require active temperature control throughout upload.

As shown in <xref rid="tb2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, chilling of the cultures for the day between handover and launch allowed for viable cultures, subjected to the same operational issues as when culturing at 20&#x000b0;C, whereas 8 days of chilling the cultures did not allow for all cultures tested to be viable.</p><p>We therefore tested short cold stowage upload (1 day handover to launch with 2 days from launch to the ISS) and longest reported cold stowage upload via Dragon (8 days) with a further half-day reduction in the time of culturing at 20&#x000b0;C. As shown in <xref rid="tb2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, both short and long cold stowage followed by 6 days of incubation produced viable cultures. These results suggested that even the longest duration cold stowage followed by a period of incubation onboard the ISS would be a suitable operational solution for MME.</p><p>As passive rather than active temperature control was preferred for upload operations, we tested the effect of passive cold stowage using NASA's phase change materials. Given that 12&#x000b0;C active temperature control during upload produced viable cultures, we first tested NASA's 12&#x000b0;C phase change materials temperature profile during long upload. As shown in <xref rid="tb2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, long cold stowage when using NASA's 12&#x000b0;C phase change materials temperature profile did not produce viable cultures, with worms running out of food about 1 day before the end of the incubation at 20&#x000b0;C.</p><p>This result may appear surprising; however, the phase change material starts at 10&#x000b0;C and ramps up to 14&#x000b0;C over the period of cold stowage.

Confirming that 10&#x000b0;C phase change materials also maintain within +/&#x02212;2&#x000b0;C, we tested long cold stowage using NASA's 10&#x000b0;C phase change materials temperature profile, which did produce viable cultures (<xref rid="tb2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Having confirmed a viable passive stowage upload scenario for MME, we finally tested the impact of a short upload scenario with the 10&#x000b0;C phase change materials (1 day turnover to launch, 3 days to station, 1 day to put in incubator) and found that this also produced viable cultures (<xref rid="tb2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, through various iterations of testing that included what we might do to culture worms in our own laboratory, to implementing operational restrictions imposed by launch and upload to the ISS coupled with a better understanding of passive cold stowage performance, we were able to achieve a viable experimental protocol.

Therefore, what should have been a straightforward repurposing of previously flown hardware became a program of work to redesign and revalidate flight hardware. This entailed dealing with the frequent challenges of successfully designing and flying an experiment to the ISS: use and validation of nonstandard laboratory hardware and validation of experimental timings for upload of biologically active experiments to the ISS.</p><p>We evaluated three culture bags based on past use in <italic>C. elegans</italic> flight experiments. Unsurprisingly, two of the bags selected to replicate bags used in previous flight performed well. However, one of the bags selected, made of FEP, was not compatible with worm growth despite having previously been used. This result was particularly striking as FEP is reported to have better gas exchange properties than PE and is why FEP bags are used to fly cell culture experiments (Vassy <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Upon closer inspection of the specifications of the PE and FEP bags, it was clear that the PE bags were half as thick as the FEP bags and therefore performed better as a gas exchange surface despite worse performance as a material.</p><p>As both PE and FEP bags are nonstandard equipment for growing <italic>C. elegans</italic>, these findings highlight the importance of properly testing proposed flight hardware before flight, as selecting FEP bags for better gas exchange and ease of use properties (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the capacity to load animals into bags via injection ports) was the operational preference before testing. Having uncovered that gas exchange did appear to be a concern for growing worms in plastic bags, we tested if culture volume to gas exchange surface area impacted culture growth. Unsurprisingly, we found that it did, which enabled us to optimize culture volume for MME, something not done for ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>We also examined worm oxygen consumption using the diet from ICE-FIRST, CeMM (Szewczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and the diet from CERISE, OP50 (Higashitani <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Consistent with the biological changes for worms grown in CeMM (Szewczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), we found that the worms consumed less oxygen. Collectively, our results suggest that growing worms in plastic culture bags does pose a challenge to worm experiment viability. The use of CeMM rather than OP50 as a food source may therefore reduce the oxygen exchange requirement and thus increase the viability of worm experiments conducted inside plastic culture bags on the ISS, but this comes with the added challenge that CeMM is more prone to become contaminated.</p><p>Regardless, it remains clear that proper ground testing is required preflight despite past successful <italic>C. elegans</italic> spaceflight experiments. Additionally, in contrast to challenges with experimental bags and gas exchange, the development of new ECs, similarly dependent on effective surface area to volume ratios, presented no problems. Gas exchange in the ECs was capable of producing a viable experiment. This result suggests that for future experiments it is likely that gas exchange between the <italic>C. elegans</italic> culture and ISS will be limited principally by the exchange properties of the culture bags and not the ECs.</p><p>The second most challenging portion of our preflight testing was testing and finalizing suitable scenarios for upload to the ISS that were consistent both with current operational realities and with successfully conducting our experiment. The data on durations from payload handover until integration on the ISS provided us with a realistic range of upload timings and should prove useful for others planning to upload via Dragon with NASA cold stowage.</p><p>Using these timings, we were able to establish that a <italic>C. elegans</italic> payload can be kept in a stasis during cold upload at 8&#x02013;12&#x000b0;C, then subsequently grow and reproduce effectively. Of note, while the use of phase change material removed the need for active temperature control during upload, it was critical that we tested the performance of the phase change material temperature profile. Indeed, for biologically active cultures, phase change material provides a significantly different temperature profile than active temperature control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s017"><title>5.&#x02002;Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have updated the flight hardware and upload conditions available to support <italic>C. elegans</italic> experiments onboard the ISS.
