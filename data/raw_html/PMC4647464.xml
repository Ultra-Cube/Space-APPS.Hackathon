This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon&#x02013;codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1. <italic>kae1</italic> hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent <italic>kae1</italic> melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand, <italic>kae1</italic> mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of <italic>kae1</italic>, whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong <italic>kae1</italic> alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Kae1</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-threonylcarbamoyladenosine</kwd><kwd>t6A</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source>Govind laboratory</funding-source><award-id>NSF-1121817</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source>NASA <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</named-content></funding-source><award-id>NNX15AB42G</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source>Singapore National Research Foundation <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001381</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-4"><funding-source>National Institute of Environmental Health Science <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</named-content></funding-source><award-id>ES017010</award-id><award-id>ES022858</award-id><award-id>ES002109</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-5"><funding-source>National Science Foundation <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</named-content></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1412379</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-6"><funding-source>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id>P01-GM088297</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-7"><funding-source>Burroughs Wellcome Foundation <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-8"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM083300</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-9"><funding-source>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</named-content></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS083833</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-10"><funding-source>Memorial Sloan-Kettering Core</funding-source><award-id>P30-CA008748</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Beyond the four canonical ribonucleosides present in RNA, nearly all life forms bear an array of modified bases in various transcript populations. Over 100 chemical modifications have been documented, with dozens often present in individual species; the majority of distinct modified ribonucleosides occur on tRNA (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C34" ref-type="bibr">Machnicka et al. 2013</xref>). Altogether, RNA modifications collectively play diverse roles in RNA quality control, secondary structure, transcript stability, translational efficiency, translational fidelity, and regulation of RNA&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C15" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="LINRNA053934C21" ref-type="bibr">Hopper and Huang 2015</xref>) and can influence disease and cancer progression (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C13" ref-type="bibr">Grewal 2015</xref>; <xref rid="LINRNA053934C26" ref-type="bibr">Kirchner and Ignatova 2015</xref>).</p><p>While many post-transcriptional modifications of RNA are broadly conserved, only a few are universal across known life forms. One prominent example is <italic>N</italic><sup><italic>6</italic></sup>-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A), which is found at high frequency at position 37 of tRNAs that decode ANN codons (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C14" ref-type="bibr">Grosjean et al. 1995</xref>). This modification was recognized decades ago, and it stabilizes cognate codon&#x02013;anticodon interactions through a stacking interaction that stabilizes the weak interaction with the first codon base, which comprises a weak A&#x02013;U pair (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C52" ref-type="bibr">Weissenbach and Grosjean 1981</xref>; <xref rid="LINRNA053934C53" ref-type="bibr">Yarian et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="LINRNA053934C1" ref-type="bibr">Agris 2008</xref>). However, the enzymes that generate this modification remained elusive until relatively recently.</p><p>Based on the inference that all organisms harbor t6A-modified tRNAs (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C45" ref-type="bibr">Sprinzl and Vassilenko 2005</xref>), bioinformatic isolation of universally conserved genes of unknown function (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C11" ref-type="bibr">Galperin and Koonin 2004</xref>) yielded a short list of candidate genes that first led to the identification of YrdC/Sua5 as a t6A pathway component (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C9" ref-type="bibr">El Yacoubi et al. 2009</xref>). Subsequently, members of the universal gene family Kae1/Qri7/YgjD were recognized to be essential for t6A biosynthesis, along with its partner proteins (in yeast) Pcc1 and Bud32 (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C10" ref-type="bibr">El Yacoubi et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="LINRNA053934C46" ref-type="bibr">Srinivasan et al. 2011</xref>). Of note, mutations in components of the Kae1, Pcc1, Bud32, and Cgi121 complex (collectively termed KEOPS) had been isolated some years earlier, via divergent approaches intended at identifying factors in telomere maintenance (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C8" ref-type="bibr">Downey et al. 2006</xref>) and splicing/transcription (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C27" ref-type="bibr">Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006</xref>). At the time, the molecular role of the KEOPS complex was obscure, but its deep conservation justified solving the atomic structures of the archaeal Kae1/Bud32 natural fusion protein (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C19" ref-type="bibr">Hecker et al. 2008</xref>) and the entire eukaryotic KEOPS complex (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C35" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al. 2008</xref>). These studies assigned Kae1 as an ASKHA-type ATPase, Bud32 as a kinase, and Pcc1 as a dimerization subunit, with Kae1 physically interacting with both Bud32 and Pcc1.</p><p>Only later, with the recognition that these genes are involved in t6A accumulation, did efforts become possible to reconstitute the biosynthesis of t6A-modified tRNA in vitro, using purified bacterial YrdC (Sua5) and YgjD (Kae1) and two bacterial-specific genes that cluster with YgjD, namely YjeE and YeaZ (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C6" ref-type="bibr">Deutsch et al. 2012</xref>). Similarly, yeast Sua5 and KEOPS complex sufficed to generate t6A-modified tRNA in vitro (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C42" ref-type="bibr">Perrochia et al. 2013</xref>). The proposed mechanism is that Sua5 converts bicarbonate and threonine via a series of intermediates into threonylcarbamoyladenylate, which is transferred to the active site of Kae1 within the KEOPS complex to modify tRNA position A37.</p><p>Notably, Kae1 is the only truly universally conserved component of KEOPS (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C11" ref-type="bibr">Galperin and Koonin 2004</xref>), and eukaryotes contain a paralog of Kae1 termed Qri7 that is mitochondrially localized (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C22" ref-type="bibr">Huh et al. 2003</xref>). The fact that no other KEOPS components localize to mitochondria led to a suspicion that Qri7 represents a primal core factor that does not require additional presumably accessory KEOPS components. Indeed, subcellular redirection of Qri7 to the cytoplasm rescued the slow growth phenotypes of all KEOPS members that are defective for t6A accumulation (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C49" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al. 2013</xref>). Moreover, in vitro synthesis of t6A-modified tRNA was reconstituted solely with purified Sua5, Qri7, and substrate tRNA, in the presence of threonine, bicarbonate, and ATP (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C49" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al. 2013</xref>). Thus, Kae1/Qri7 is the central downstream enzyme in the generation of t6A-modified tRNA.</p><p>The assignment of core genes in the t6A pathway permits organismal phenotypes to be correlated with the absence of these modified tRNAs. Budding yeast t6A pathway mutants (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C9" ref-type="bibr">El Yacoubi et al. 2009</xref>, <xref rid="LINRNA053934C10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="LINRNA053934C46" ref-type="bibr">Srinivasan et al. 2011</xref>) are very slow-growing, while the bacterial pathway (e.g., in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) is essential for viability and cell morphology (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C3" ref-type="bibr">Arigoni et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="LINRNA053934C17" ref-type="bibr">Handford et al. 2009</xref>). These seemingly general defects befit loss of a fundamental RNA modification pathway, but do not lend insight into particular processes. Otherwise, mutants of KEOPS complex members in single-celled organisms have impact on telomere maintenance (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C8" ref-type="bibr">Downey et al. 2006</xref>), transcription (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C27" ref-type="bibr">Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006</xref>), and genome stability (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C40" ref-type="bibr">Oberto et al. 2009</xref>), although it remains unclear how directly the loss of t6A relates to these phenotypes.</p><p>However, certain phenotypes now seem to be directly related to the biochemical function of t6A in improving translational fidelity. Of note, yeast <italic>sua5</italic> was originally isolated as a suppressor of <italic>cyc1</italic> alleles harboring an aberrant upstream start codon (uORF) (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C16" ref-type="bibr">Hampsey et al. 1991</xref>; <xref rid="LINRNA053934C39" ref-type="bibr">Na et al. 1992</xref>), implicating Sua5 in start site selection; AUG is indeed recognized by a t6A-modified tRNA. Correspondingly, Sua5 affects various aspects of normal translation, as mutants exhibit increased leaky scanning through AUG, frameshifting, and nonsense suppression (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C32" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al. 2010</xref>). One prominent locus controlled via endogenous uORFs is the amino acid starvation-responsive transcription factor GCN4 (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C20" ref-type="bibr">Hinnebusch 2005</xref>). Indeed, not only does <italic>sua5</italic> derepress <italic>GCN4</italic>, KEOPS mutants (<italic>kae1</italic> and <italic>pcc1</italic>) induce a gene expression signature that is substantially enriched for Gcn4 targets (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C5" ref-type="bibr">Daugeron et al. 2011</xref>). These precedents suggest that it may be possible to make linkages between altered translation and organismal phenotypes, even for this &#x0201c;housekeeping&#x0201d; cellular activity.</p><p>To date, genetic analysis of t6A pathway components has mostly been limited to single cell organisms, such as microbes and yeast. One study on the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Bud32/PRPK homolog utilized RNAi-mediated knockdowns to define growth related defects upon <italic>bud32</italic> depletion, although biochemical evidence was not presented for an impact on t6A biogenesis in this condition (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C23" ref-type="bibr">Ibar et al. 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the growth defects were related to PI3K/TOR signaling, and could be partially restored by expression of activated S6-kinase (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C23" ref-type="bibr">Ibar et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we describe the isolation of a large allelic series of <italic>D. melanogaster kae1</italic> mutants, ranging from weak hypomorphs, strong mutants, to null alleles. These present various growth-related defects, developmental delay, and melanotic tumors. We present extensive biochemical and genetic evidence that <italic>Drosophila kae1</italic> and its partners are core factors in t6A biogenesis. Notably, our phenotypic analysis reveals substantial differences in the genetic requirements for t6A in proliferating versus nonproliferating tissues. In particular, analysis of mitotic tissues in full knockout and in clonal settings indicates an essential requirement for <italic>kae1</italic>, whereas various nonproliferating tissues can be maintained in the null state for weeks. Moreover, <italic>kae1</italic> appears to act as a tumor suppressor in the larval hematopoietic tissue. These data highlight biological complexity in the requirements of a general regulatory factor, and the utility of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model to further understand the roles of t6A modification during animal development and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation of the &#x0201c;<italic>Black Spot</italic>&#x0201d; complementation group</title><p>During efforts to isolate mutants in the 72D-F region, we conducted an F2 EMS mutagenesis screen against <italic>Df(3L)ED220</italic>, which deletes 324,210 bp of chromosome 3L:16,080,584&#x02013;16,404,777 (see Materials and Methods). We screened &#x0223c;7000 crosses of animals bearing mutagenized chromosomes to this deficiency, and recovered 64 lethals. Within this collection, we recognized numerous alleles for which hemizygous larvae bore characteristic melanotic masses, which we colloquially termed &#x0201c;<italic>Black Spot</italic>&#x0201d; mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="LINRNA053934F1">Fig. 1</xref>A). These mutants failed to complement each other, and they typically exhibited an extended larval period prior to lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="LINRNA053934F1">Fig. 1</xref>B&#x02013;D; Supplemental Fig. 1). Notably, while <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae complete their larval stages around day 5 and commence pupation, some <italic>Black Spot</italic> mutants survive as larvae for up to 18 d. Systematic tests against all of the lethal alleles we obtained in this genomic interval revealed additional noncomplementing mutations. Many of these mutants lacked black spots or generated them with low frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="LINRNA053934F1">Fig. 1</xref>B&#x02013;D). Several of these alleles were able to develop to pupal stages or even into pharate adults as hemizygotes, suggesting they might represent hypomorphs.

Nevertheless, our original isolation of <italic>kae1</italic> mutants as extremely long-lived larvae exhibiting hematopoietic expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="LINRNA053934F1">Fig. 1</xref>) indicates that many cells and tissues can not only survive, but seemingly thrive in the <italic>kae1</italic> null state for weeks.

For the most part, all of these tissues are dominantly or solely composed of nonproliferating cells during the larval stages. Therefore, these observations solidify the notion that mitotic cells are preferentially affected by loss of <italic>kae1</italic>. However, this does not mean that defects were lacking in these other larval tissues. Interestingly, quantitative analysis showed tissue-specific and allele-specific differences between their behavior. For example, even though <italic>kae1[1A13]/Df</italic> mutants maintain only marginally more t6A than <italic>kae1[f10978]/Df</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="LINRNA053934F3">Fig. 3</xref>C), we observed progressively smaller salivary glands in <italic>kae1</italic> mutants with less t6A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="LINRNA053934F7">Fig. 7</xref>J). More strikingly, the size of salivary gland cells was mostly unaffected in <italic>[1A13]</italic> hemizygotes, whereas they were tiny by comparison in <italic>[f10978]</italic> hemizygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="LINRNA053934F7">Fig. 7</xref>K). Thus, the slight amount of t6A in a strongly hypomorphic <italic>kae1</italic> condition can maintain salivary gland cell size, even though these glands evidently have fewer cells than normal, whereas the null condition compromises both cell and organ size in the salivary gland. In contrast, the absolute size of the body wall musculature is largely unaffected in <italic>kae1[1A13]/Df</italic>, and only slightly reduced in the <italic>kae1[f10978]/Df</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="LINRNA053934F7">Fig. 7</xref>L,M). Indeed, the small size of <italic>kae1</italic> null larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="LINRNA053934F1">Fig. 1</xref>E) may be sufficient to explain the small size of its muscles, which are expected to scale to body size.</p><fig id="LINRNA053934F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p>Differential requirements of <italic>kae1</italic> in mitotic vs. nonproliferating tissues.

Furthermore, knockdown approaches do not generally achieve genetic null states.</p><p>We demonstrate loss of t6A-modified tRNAs in <italic>Drosophila kae1</italic> mutants, using both primer extension of individual species and mass spectrometry to examine the bulk population. Moreover, we demonstrate substantial cross-species rescue by fly Kae1 (and its partners) in yeast <italic>kae1</italic> mutants, both in terms of growth capacity and in recovery of t6A-modified tRNAs.

This raises two general possibilities. First, it may be that t6A-modified tRNAs are exceptionally stable in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In this scenario, even though we assayed timepoints going well past the established range of maternal effects (e.g., up to 18 d, or the equivalent of a week-old adult fly), those modified tRNAs that were maternally deposited or generated from maternal <italic>kae1</italic> mRNA and/or protein persisted all that time. Alternatively, many species, including yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, express a mitochondrial Kae1 paralog named Qri7. Although mitochondrially derived t6A appears to comprise a minute portion of the total pool in single-celled organisms, the situation might be different in a metazoan. For example, the substantial populations of nonproliferating tissues that tolerate deletion of <italic>kae1</italic> include the larval musculature, which sustain larval locomotion in mutants for weeks. Therefore, the remaining t6A-modified tRNAs in <italic>kae1</italic> null mutant larvae may potentially be contributed by the abundant mitochondria in muscles. In the future, characterization of a <italic>Drosophila Qri7</italic> (<italic>CG14231</italic>) knockout would provide a useful comparison, especially to see if Qri7 loss preferentially affects tissues with exceptional needs for oxidative phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>An extensive allelic series of <italic>kae1</italic> mutants reveal diverse biology of t6A</title><p>The first allele in a t6A biogenesis component, yeast <italic>sua5-1</italic>, was isolated in a forward genetic screen as an extragenic suppressor of a mutant <italic>cyc1</italic> allele bearing an aberrant uORF (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C16" ref-type="bibr">Hampsey et al. 1991</xref>).

We document allele-specific phenotypic severities in different tissues, and also note that biochemically strong hypomorphs exhibit modest phenotypes in some settings (e.g., exhibit normal somatic musculature) but phenocopy null alleles in other settings (e.g., completely lack imaginal discs). These discrepancies highlight the utility of the allelic series in dissecting multiple requirements of essential housekeeping genes in regulating fundamental cellular processes in vivo. Future studies can continue to exploit these alleles to elucidate the biology of t6A modification. For example, it remains unclear what underlying causes provoke the dramatic hematopoietic responses in <italic>kae1</italic> mutants, and our alleles provide unique means for querying this. Of note, substantial hematopoietic overgrowth is observed in both strong hypomorphs and the null condition, but only the former proceeds reliably toward generation of melanotic nodules.</p><p>The <italic>kae1</italic> alleles we report should also be valuable for understanding the mechanism of t6A modification.

Here, we find evidence for differential requirements for <italic>kae1</italic> in distinct cell types.</p><p>Quite noticeably, strong <italic>kae1</italic> mutants completely lack imaginal discs. The progenitor populations of discs are set aside during embryonic development, and they proliferate extensively during larval stages to generate the tissues that will form the adult body plan during metamorphosis.

Phenotypes common to loss of Kae1 and SUMO include extended larval phases before lethality, presence of melanotic tumors, and preferential defects in mitotic versus nonproliferating cells, as evidenced by their lack of imaginal discs while retaining diverse other larval tissues (<xref rid="LINRNA053934C24" ref-type="bibr">Kalamarz et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="LINRNA053934C25" ref-type="bibr">Kanakousaki and Gibson 2012</xref>).

Altogether, these analyses highlight how mutations in seemingly &#x0201c;general&#x0201d; cellular regulators can reveal tissue-specific requirements. Moreover, they suggest that several fundamental regulatory pathways are preferentially required in highly mitotic tissues. Whether this simply indicates that diverse processes mutate to a common terminal zygotic phenotype, reflecting the distinct biology of mitotic and nonproliferating cells, or whether there are actually mechanistic links between t6A, SUMO, and the cell cycle, remains to be dissected in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genetic screen for <italic>kae1</italic> alleles</title><p>The region uncovered by <italic>Df(3L)ED220</italic> was subjected to a lethal F2 screen after EMS mutagenesis.
