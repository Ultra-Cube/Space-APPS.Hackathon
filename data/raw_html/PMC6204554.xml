The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound effects on how an organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, <italic>Opsanus tau</italic>, in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1&#x02013;32-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1&#x02013;8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent vestibular pathway. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228&#x000b0;/s constant angular velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Afferents studied after 228&#x000b0;/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without centripetal acceleration, called On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their control counterparts. Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3&#x02013;4 days followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed after 4 days of HG took &#x0003e;4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after 16 days of HG took &#x0003e;2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the <italic>same</italic> fish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found. Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g resembles in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>afferents</kwd><kwd>hair cells</kwd><kwd>acceleration</kwd><kwd>gravity</kwd><kwd>centrifugation</kwd><kwd>spaceflight</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>serial electron microscopy reconstruction</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="125"/><page-count count="22"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Gravity is a natural force that drives all living organisms to acquire precise physiological mechanisms to survive. Throughout the course of a species&#x02019; evolution the intensity and direction of gravity have remained constant, whereas other environmental factors, such as predation, climate, vegetation, for example, with rare exceptions have not. The highly evolved inner ear neural systems in vertebrates are keyed to operating under gravity&#x02019;s continuous influence (<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Stensi&#x000f6;</xref>, <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">1927</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Friedman and Giles, 2017</xref>). Detections of inertial acceleration, such as linear translation during self-motion or an external perturbation, and head orientation with respect to gravity, such as tilts, start from the bilateral otolith organs. The first vertebrate ear was principally a graviceptive statocyst more commonly found in today&#x02019;s aquatic invertebrates (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Budelmann, 1988</xref>). Otolith structures contain an inertial mass of calcium carbonate that is subject to the pull of gravity and thus possesses weight. In an earlier study (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>) fish were exposed to near weightlessness in spaceflight and in this study we exposed the fish to centrifugation to enhance the gravity load and queried in a similar fashion the sensory processing characteristics of otolith afferents.</p><p>Pervasiveness of gravity provides the nervous system a common reference about which to optimize sensory transduction mechanisms and perception. Otolith afferents carry the transduced signal of the gravito-inertial forces in the form of modulated spacing of action potentials to the brainstem and cerebellum (see <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg et al., 2012</xref>). There the otolith code combines with angular acceleration signals obtained from the semicircular canals and with information derived from the visual and somesthetic modalities to compute a central representation of the body and its parts as well as their dynamics in space. The end result is the resolution of ambiguity of gravity and self-motion to allow healthy individuals to maintain balance and equilibrium under varying conditions. Despite invariability of gravity on Earth, physiological systems are not and are adversely affected by trauma, disease, and aging, and thus central creation of the gravito-inertial vector can be disrupted leading to vertigo, disorientation, and other clinical disorders.</p><p>Arrival of aviation and space age offered a means to directly study the role of gravity in healthy subjects. The established reference of self-orientation is now completely violated by the speed at which the individual and visual world on the retina move and by rapidly changing orientation of the gravity vector with respect to the pilot, or removal of gravity vector altogether in space missions. During the first days of spaceflight, most astronauts experience symptoms of space motion sickness and disorientation (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Reschke et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Demontis et al., 2017</xref>) linked to the otolith organs (<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Watt et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Paloski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Heer and Paloski, 2006</xref>). An extraordinary hypersensitivity to applied acceleration was observed in toadfish utricle afferents after relatively short mission aboard Shuttle orbiters (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>). The hypersensitivity presumably was the result of exposure to near weightlessness, persisted over the first day after landing, returned to within normal levels on the second day at 1 g, and closely matched the reported readaptation in astronauts after landing following a comparable stay in space (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Reschke et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Physiological adjustments to a novel gravity, as witnessed in spaceflight, reveal that the organism possesses adaptive mechanisms triggered by transitions in gravity. What initiates these mechanisms and are they compensatory to the gravity load? In addition to the sensory afferent pathways the brain in turn sends efferent signals back to the same inner ear structures. Activation of olivo-cochlear efferent neurons can attenuate afferent sensitivity and reduce its frequency selectivity or tuning to sound (<xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Warr and Guinan, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Liberman, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Groff and Liberman, 2003</xref>). In functional terms, this efferent-to-afferent feedback loop adjusts sensitivity of hearing in a frequency dependent way (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Russell and Murugasu, 1997</xref>). Analogous to the cochlea, efferent synaptic terminals contact both vestibular hair cells and afferents (<xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Rasmussen, 1968</xref>; <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Sans and Highstein, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Holstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Lysakowski and Goldberg, 2008</xref>), and activation of efferent synapses influences afferent sensitivity in fish (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Flock and Russell, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann and Klinke, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Boyle and Highstein, 1990b</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2009</xref>), frog (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Gribenski and Caston, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Valli et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Chagnaud et al., 2015</xref>), turtle (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Brichta and Goldberg, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Holt et al., 2006</xref>), bird (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Dickman and Correia, 1992</xref>), chinchilla (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Marlinski et al., 2004</xref>), and primates (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg and Fern&#x000e1;ndez, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Sadeghi et al., 2009</xref>). Reflex or self-generated movements often have large purposeful acceleration components, such as those occurring during predation (attack) and avoidance (escape) behaviors that would impair the computation of a movement, and importantly any novel perturbations encountered during execution of those behaviors. To enable the afferent to continuously encode motion profiles during such overt behaviors its sensitivity to acceleration is reduced, often dramatically, but it is not clear whether the prevailing gravity load is registered by the efferent system and participates in adaptive processes.</p><p>Another possible participant in adaptive processes in the peripheral labyrinth is a rapid addition or removal of synaptic bodies associated with the hair cell-afferent synapse. <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Ross (2000)</xref> found the number of synaptic ribbons in rat type II otolith hair cells increased two to threefold following 14-day exposure to weightlessness. Since toadfish possess only type II hair cells, an attractive interpretation of our earlier afferent data (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>) was an increase in synaptic strength as an initial adaptive response to restore the &#x0201c;lost&#x0201d; gravity detection, followed by a deletion of the added synaptic bodies (<xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Waites et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Matthews and Fuchs, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Graydon et al., 2017</xref>) leading to a restoration of normal sensation after a return to 1 g. Here, we manipulate the afferent responses to acceleration by applying variable exposures to hypergravity (HG) via centrifugation and directly correlate the observed afferent sensitivity with serial reconstruction of hair cell-afferent complexes in two areas of the utricular macula in the <italic>same</italic> animal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>General Procedures</title><p>Oyster toadfish, <italic>Opsanus tau</italic>, of either sex, weighing &#x0223c;400 g, were provided by the Resources Facilities of Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA, United States). Fish were housed in 300 l saltwater aquaria systems (AquaLogic, San Diego, CA, United States) and monitored daily by the veterinarian staff. All procedures followed the principles set forth by NIH &#x0201c;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Ed 8&#x0201d; and approved by NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Useful data were acquired from 106 fish.</p><p>Immediately after removal from the centrifuge aquarium (&#x0003c;1 min) the fish was immersed in the anesthetic agent MS222 (25 mg/l, 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States) diluted in saltwater (Instant Ocean<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). Fish was then placed in a Lexan polycarbonate tank filled with chilled (15&#x000b0;C) saltwater, and its head was stabilized in an Earth horizontal plane using a mouth brace and immobilized with stainless steel pins to the cranium; saltwater covered all but its most dorsal surface, and its eyes and dorsal fins were covered with moist tissues. Saltwater was aerated using an air stone. MS222 was added as needed during the course of the experiment.</p><p>A small craniotomy was made to visualize the anterior and horizontal canal (HC) ampullae and the utricle and their specific nerve supply. Fluorocarbon (FC75, 3M Corp, Minneapolis, MN, United States) was injected into the cranial opening to fill the perilymphatic vestibule. The dorsal surfaces of the brainstem and posterior cerebellum were exposed by removing &#x0223c;3 mm<sup>2</sup> portion of occiput above the foramen magnum. Efferent vestibular nuclei are seen as paramedial gray areas among the transversely running internal arcuate fibers under the floor of the IVth ventricle (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Highstein and Baker, 1986</xref>). A pair of sharpened Ag/AgCl wires insulated to within 0.2 mm of their tips and spaced &#x0223c;2 mm was lowered into the efferent nuclei on either side of the midline along a &#x0223c;45&#x000b0; angle beneath the posterior cerebellum to a depth of 1&#x02013;2 mm. EVS activation behaviorally provoked or electrically induced elicits an early arousal reaction, characterized by an initial flaring of lateral fins and raising of dorsal fin, followed by straightening of the tail and extension of the ventral fins (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Highstein and Baker, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Boyle and Highstein, 1990b</xref>). Fin flaring was used as a guide for proper placement of electrode array that required the lowest shock intensity. Alert fish activate their EVS at a maximum rate of &#x0223c;100 impulses/s (ips) (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Highstein and Baker, 1985</xref>), and efferent nerves faithfully follow a 100 Hz stimulus train applied to the nuclei (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Boyle and Highstein, 1990b</xref>). EVS stimulation consisted of single pulses of 100 &#x003bc;s duration with trains of 100/s were delivered in a bipolar fashion via a pulse generator coupled to a stimulus isolation unit and captured as time-stamped events in Spike2 (CED, United Kingdom). Conventional 30&#x02013;50 M&#x003a9; glass microelectrodes, filled with 2 M LiCl<sub>2</sub>, were used for extracellular or pseudo-intra-axonal recordings under direct visual control. The recording session began less than 1 h after cessation of centrifugation and typically lasted 12&#x02013;14 h.</p><p>In preliminary experiments, we noticed utricular afferents were inconsistently responsive to EVS stimulation, while at the same time HC afferents were consistently activated. Therefore, responses of &#x0223c;5&#x02013;10 HC afferents were recorded at the start of each session to adjust and confirm efferent stimulation parameters. Sinusoids of 10&#x02013;20&#x000b0;/s at 0.5&#x02013;5 Hz were delivered about the <italic>z</italic>-axis (yaw rotation) as well as visual localization to identify canal afferents. Consistency of stimulus intensity was verified throughout the experiment. Another set of canal afferents (range 8&#x02013;27) was recorded at the end of each session to confirm EVS efficacy and evaluate canal response to rotation.</p></sec><sec><title>Centrifugation Procedures</title><p>NASA Ames prototype centrifuge was used to subject the fish to HG of variable duration and magnitude (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The centrifuge consists of four radial arms with a one-degree of freedom swing gondola (labeled A1) at the end of each arm to maintain gravity vector relative to the fish during rest and centrifugation and positioned 1.22 m eccentric to center of rotation. Two magnitudes of HG were applied. Main protocol was a 38-rpm spin delivering a 1 g (Earth) plus 2 G (centripetal) force imparting a 2.24 g (=sqrt(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>)) resultant force. Duration of 2.24 g exposures was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 16, 24, or 32 days in groups of four to five fish. In separate experiments, the spin was reduced to 19 rpm resulting in a 1 g centripetal force or 1.12 g (=sqrt(1<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup>)) resultant force; duration of 1.12 g exposures in groups of four fish was confined to 4 and 16 days. Loading and unloading of fish were scheduled to minimize the stop time, typically &#x0003c;10 min. Twelve separate runs were conducted over a 3-year period to acquire the reported HG results.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Experimental and testing devices. <bold>(A)</bold> Ground-based centrifuge was used to apply centripetal force by constant velocity rotation within a concomitant 1 g environment. Centrifuge had four gondolas (labeled A1) positioned at a radial distance of 1.22 m from center of axis of rotation. Each gondola was gimbaled with one-degree of freedom to deliver a constant gravity vector onto fish at any given rotational rate. Self-contained aquarium systems (labeled A2) were developed to permit life support for one fish in each gondola consisting of mechanical and biological filtrations, cooling, and oxygenation within a 12:12 light:dark cycle.

An individual habitat (labeled A2) was placed in each gondola, contained &#x0223c;20 l of saltwater and housed either one fish or none at a time (for scheduling). A closed loop system continuously circulated water through mechanical and biological filtrations and a heat exchanger to chill the saltwater to 15&#x000b0;C on the return side. The room was cooled to &#x0003c;15&#x000b0;C to counter heat generated by the motor. A DC powered air stone aerated the saltwater, and pressure was released via a one-way valve. Light/dark (12:12 h) cycles during centrifugation were normalized to home aquaria. Fish were unrestrained and allowed to swim freely in the habitat. During centrifugation, two forces are applied to the fish in addition to the constant force of gravity: a centripetal force dependent on radius of eccentricity and rate of rotation. To account for possible variations in vestibular function due to rate of rotation, a separate rate table was configured that permitted a single tank to be placed precisely at the center of rotation axis. These On-Center Control (OCC) experiments were conducted one fish at a time with a spin of 38 rpm for groups of four fish at either 4- or 16-day duration. All parameters were matched to the centrifuged fish with the exception that no (or negligible) centripetal force was imparted to the fish. Fish were monitored in the light cycle using video. No off-nominal events occurred during any test.</p><sec><title>Acceleration Testing Device</title><p>After surgical preparation the tank (labeled B1) was mounted to a multi-axis linear and angular acceleration and tilt system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Head position of the fish was adjusted to align the otoliths coplanar to Earth horizon using digital commands to one or more axes. The cranial opening was positioned beneath a castle-like structure on which a three-axes remotely controlled motorized micromanipulator (MP-285; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, United States) and preamplifier were fixed.</p><p>The fish tank and castle-like platform were attached to a Plexiglas<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> plate (labeled B2) supported by a 15.24-cm dia thrust bearing and attached to a stepper motor (labeled B3) geared (55:1) at 90&#x000b0; (graphically illustrated) to provide a full rotation about the vertical <italic>z</italic>-axis (yaw); one stepper count equals 0.00026&#x000b0;. This axis allows smooth positioning from one head angle to another with respect to the translational axis to examine afferent directional selectivity, together with applied yaw rotational stimuli. Its center of rotation passed through the center of the head and bilateral labyrinths. Yaw stage was mounted to a 2.54-cm dia shaft through roller bearing pillow blocks to a stepper motor (labeled B4) straight geared (55:1); one stepper count equals 0.00026&#x000b0;. This axis allowed tilt about the axis coplanar to the Earth horizontal (graphically illustrated), and provided either static positioning or dynamic stimuli at angles between pure roll and pure pitch depending on the head angle command to the yaw motor. Next, the tilt stage was attached to a base plate (labeled B5) through roll bearing pillow blocks and stepper motor mount. The base plate was attached to a thrust block brushless linear motor (not visible in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), which was in turn mounted to a 165-cm precision linear bearing guidance system (IDC, Petaluma, CA, United States) (labeled B6); a non-contact, incremental linear encoder provided a position sensing with 10 &#x003bc;m accuracy and voltage proportional to instantaneous linear velocity was derived from the servo controller; this signal was integrated in Spike2 data acquisition software to obtain a derived acceleration signal. A second, slaved rail, and linear bearing gliders (labeled B7) were coupled to the thrust block to provide additional stability and lower the center of mass of the top plate. The device was secured to an optical breadboard (TMC) (labeled B8) to ensure flatness and provide isolation, and floated from the lab floor by jelly pads to absorb substrate-borne vibrations. Unit recording stability was confirmed up to 0.5 g at 12 Hz (maximum tested). A digital controller (Galil Motion Control, Rocklin, CA, United States) installed on a Windows-based platform provided command signals to each motor. Software control was based on Galil motion control libraries called from a user interface written in Igor (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, United States) scripts to permit step or continuous, dynamic motion about one or more axes at selectable parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Terminology of Motion Stimuli</title><p><italic>Lab-defined frame of motion</italic> reference along the horizontal axis at 0&#x000b0; corresponded to a positive acceleration directed forward out the fish&#x02019;s snout; activation of the tilt stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, B4</xref>) at this position delivered a <italic>pure roll</italic> to one side or the other. Activation of the yaw stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, B3</xref>) produced counter-clockwise (CCW) or CW rotation in the horizontal plane to change the head orientation with respect to the linear motion. Yaw rotation of the platform to + 90&#x000b0; (right-hand rule, CCW) about the <italic>z</italic>-axis produced a positive inter-aural acceleration directed out the right (ipsilateral to recording side) ear and the converse out the opposite ear, and activation of the tilt stage produced a <italic>pure pitch</italic> with either head-down or -up. Yaw rotation of the platform to 180&#x000b0; about the <italic>z</italic>-axis produced a positive sled acceleration directed forward but now out the fish&#x02019;s tail, and activation of the tilt stage produced again a <italic>pure roll</italic> to one side or the other. Yaw rotation of platform to 270&#x000b0; about the <italic>z</italic>-axis produced a positive acceleration directed out the left (contralateral to recording side) ear and the converse out the right ear, and activation of the tilt stage produced again a <italic>pure pitch</italic>. Sinusoidal translation along the horizontal plane ranged from 0.03 to 0.3 g at 0.3&#x02013;5 Hz and was limited by the excursion of the rail; sinusoidal tilt stimuli ranged from 0.01 to 2&#x000b0; at 0.3&#x02013;10 Hz and up to 5&#x000b0; static tilt and the parameters tested were dependent mainly on recording stability; sinusoidal yaw rotations were confined to 10&#x02013;30&#x000b0;/s at 0.1&#x02013;5 Hz.</p></sec><sec><title>Vestibular Test Protocol</title><p>Test protocol was designed to provide direct comparisons of afferent responses to translation within and across the populations subjected to different HG and adaptation conditions.

The hair cell&#x02019;s bundle is morphologically polarized (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Wers&#x000e4;ll, 1972</xref>) and its receptor potential is directionally sensitive and behaves as a rectified cosine-function to bundle displacement (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Hudspeth and Corey, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Shotwell et al., 1981</xref>); the functional polarization vectors of utricular afferents are distributed in a fanlike shape (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez and Goldberg, 1976b</xref>), as is to be expected from the hair cell orientations in the macula (<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Spoendlin, 1964</xref>). Afferent directional selectivity was defined by its maximum (Smax) and minimum or null (Smin) sensitivities. To accomplish this a sinusoidal translation along a plane parallel to Earth was delivered as the fish was rotated about the yaw or <italic>z</italic>-axis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Angelaki and Dickman, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>) and paused to collect five or more consecutive cycles. In our standard test protocol, a 1&#x02013;2 Hz translational sinusoid was delivered at amplitude of &#x000b1;0.02&#x02013;0.05 g as the fish was stepped about the <italic>z</italic>-axis in typically successive 15&#x000b0; steps. Test magnitude was set to prevent <italic>as well as possible</italic> any nonlinear distortions of afferent impulse rate (IR) such as saturation in the ON-direction or &#x0201c;cut off&#x0201d; in the OFF-direction. In successful recordings, the afferent Smax and Smin to translation were captured within five to nine steps; in some cases, the Smin was not obvious (discussed later in the section &#x0201c;Results&#x0201d;). In many cases the recording was compromised before completing the required protocol and the data were discarded. In afferents with particularly stable recording conditions static and dynamic tilts were delivered, selected often at the <italic>z</italic>-axis angle that elicited its Smin and Smax responses to translations. Static tilts were typically &#x000b1;1&#x02013;3&#x000b0; displacement (12&#x000b0;/s<sup>2</sup> ramp on/off) and were held to determine the time course of impulse adaptation. In some instances afferent directional selectivity was determined for both translations and tilts.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Acquisition and Analysis</title><p>Data waveforms and events were digitized, displayed in real-time using Spike2 software, and stored for later analysis (CED Power 1401). Direct voltage measures of angular displacements (in degree) about the two (yaw and tilt) rotational axes, acceleration (cm/s<sup>2</sup>) from the linear encoder and the derived velocity (cm/s), and the linear accelerators (g) along the horizontal plane were amplified externally to span the full 16-bit range of the A/D converters, filtered below the Nyquist frequency, and digitized at 500&#x02013;1000 samples/s. Time stamping for stimulus trigger events, efferent shock times, and externally discriminated spike times was acquired to a resolution of 0.08 ms.</p><p>Data were imported off-line into a custom interactive analysis procedure written in Igor. Desired portions of record with respect to specific stimuli were manually selected and inspected using an interactive graphical analysis procedure. A stimulus trigger (positive zero-crossing) was used as a time reference to generate 100&#x02013;180 bin/cycle phase histograms of stimulus and response. A discrete Fourier analysis was applied to compute the first-harmonic stimulus/response amplitude and phase. Response sensitivity (afferent output/stimulus input) was calculated by dividing IR modulation of derived 1st harmonic of modulation by acceleration amplitude, e.g., impulse rate (IR) per second (ips) per cm/s<sup>2</sup> or g (9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>) linear acceleration; response phase is angle between output and input peaks in &#x000b0; using the lab-defined reference. A cosine function was applied to data in a method following (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Angelaki, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Angelaki et al., 1993</xref>) to determine degree of spatial tuning, directional selectivity, and response maximum (Smax) and its minimum (Smin). Some afferents are silenced over a portion of the stimulus cycle. In the least squares fitting procedure bins lacking data were not assigned a value of zero, and therefore the curve fit was not influenced by a truncated response. This form of response nonlinearity may lead to a misrepresentation of data because a portion of the curve fit will take negative values. When detected in real time, the stimulus was reduced in amplitude to permit a more full-cycle impulse modulation. Despite these efforts and the need to maintain comparable stimulus parameters for capturing Smax response saturation and silencing of the discharge were often unavoidable. Both the mean IR, defined as IR at half of computed peak-to-peak modulation, and the average IR, defined as number of impulses divided by stimulus cycle time, were measured. The former IR assists in detecting large truncated or clipped responses and the latter took into account the different cycle time of sinusoids used and served as a more reliable measure of IR during stimulation. Samples of IR &#x0003e;30 s in length (from 120 to &#x0003e;36,000 interspike intervals) in the absence of stimulation were taken to describe the afferent background impulse properties. Degree of regularity was evaluated by determining the non-normalized coefficient of variation (CV) of rate, defined as the standard deviation of interspike intervals divided by mean interval. An example of protocol for characterizing afferent responses in control and experimental fish to linear acceleration (panels A&#x02013;C) and to tilt (panel D) is given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.</p><p>Statistical afferent data analyses were performed using built-in one-way ANOVA packages in Igor (v.7) and KleidaGraph (v. 4.5) with <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis (Tukey&#x02019;s all pairs comparison test).

The pipette was attached to a 1 ml syringe, and the endolymph was flushed with fixative solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sucrose, and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Perfusate was colorized using alcian blue to visualize it flowing across the anterior ampulla, entering the utricular space and duct, and exiting via the common crus from the distal end of the cut canal limb. The utricle and a portion of its nerve were extracted, and the utricle was opened to expose the macula and immersed in fixative overnight. Maculae were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide with 1.25% potassium ferrocyanide, dehydrated, infiltrated, and embedded in Epon. Blocks were sectioned using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome in 1-&#x003bc;m thick sections for surveying and 180 nm sections for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Synaptic Body Counts</title><p>To provide uniformity of synaptic body (SB) counts within our samples and allow direct comparison with a previous work, a protocol based on <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Ross (2000)</xref> was used. The Epon block was cut in 1 &#x003bc;m sections along the short axis of macula to survey the start of the striola border. Once confirmed 100 sections at 1 &#x003bc;m thickness were collected for a separate morphometric evaluation. From that point 150 serial sections of 180 nm thickness were collected to characterize the striola region on both sides of the hair bundle reversal line; a separate comparable collection of serial thin sections was obtained 150 &#x003bc;m medially to characterize the medial extrastriola zone of the macula. Sections were collected individually, mounted on Butvar-coated slot grids, and studied with a Leo 912 AB transmission electron microscope. More details on the ultrastructure of the toadfish utricle and the three-dimensional reconstruction of hair cells can be found in <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al.

Digital mosaics were made using the Olympus Soft Imaging System MegaView III digital camera at 5000&#x000d7; (microscopic) magnification from every seventh section and the hair cells were numbered. Mosaicked sections served as maps for locating and identifying the numbered hair cells in non-mosaic sections. Every hair cell on every section (mosaic and non-mosaic) was examined for presence of synaptic bodies and hair cell-afferent synapses. Sections were initially analyzed at 8000&#x000d7; magnification, and suspected synapses were enlarged to 12,500&#x000d7; for validation (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). Digital images of all likely synaptic bodies were taken and coded with a number for the section, hair cell, and number of synapses present. A low power image (4000&#x000d7;) was also taken for better cell identification on the map. Combined data were used to accept or reject probable synaptic bodies. Synapses or other structural features of interest were also photographed at this time. Images were transferred to an SGI Onyx for permanent storage and further synapse analysis. For counting, synapses were recorded on sheets of paper on which there are numbered contours of identified hair cells, with the numbers matching those on the maps. Strict criteria for counting synaptic bodies were followed. Only structures consisting of a central, electron-opaque body (presynaptic density), and a halo of vesicles were counted. Panels A and B in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> show digital images of two consecutive sections separated by section thickness of 180 nm. Arrows in each panel point to the same single SB in the hair cell. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> shows a cartoon of 2 of the 10 hair cells on either side of the reversal line in the striola as an illustration of method used in tabulating the results. Greater than 90% of synaptic bodies are single specializations along the hair cell internal wall, followed by pairs of bodies, and rarely a cluster of three or more bodies. Because of the time required to perform this task, typically 3&#x02013;4 months full-time effort per macula, SB counts were done from selected fish in which extensive physiological data were first obtained. Synaptic ribbons in utricular hair cells were analyzed using the ANOVA and MANOVA features of SuperANOVA<sup>TM</sup> software.

A representative utricular afferent behavior in control fish to linear acceleration (panels A&#x02013;C) and to tilt (panel D) is given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. Orientation of the fish about the <italic>z</italic>-axis (Yaw Position in A) was set at 90&#x000b0; to provide a positive acceleration directed out the fish&#x02019;s right ear along the inter-aural axis ipsilateral to the recording site. Nine consecutive cycles of sinusoidal linear acceleration (&#x000b1;15.7 cm/s<sup>2</sup> or &#x000b1;0.016 g) at 2 Hz were recorded (A) and averaged (B) to give a response of the following characteristics: averaged modulation was &#x000b1;51.7 ips about a fitted rate of 47 ips, with a sensitivity of 3.3 ips/cm/s<sup>2</sup> or 3234 ips/g occurring at peak phase of -134&#x000b0; re: acceleration. Average IR was 41 ips/cycle indicating a slight silencing of its rate in the OFF-direction. This response represented the afferent Smax. Afferent directional selectivity, a critical parameter to measure across experimental fish to precisely establish Smax, the spatio-temporal characteristics of averaged data at different head angles are plotted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>. Cartoons of fish show the direction of +linear acceleration at five different fish orientations. Smax (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) is the uppermost point (solid circle) on the yellow line. Rotation of fish about the <italic>z</italic>-axis from Smax at 90&#x000b0; head angle (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>) by half-circle to 270&#x000b0; head angle elicited a comparable and expected Smax along the inter-aural axis but with a 180&#x000b0; phase shift due to the lab-specific denotation. Peak of response modulation with respect to peak acceleration amplitude typically remained consistent over a hemi-field of head angles, rectified as the polarity shifted in the lab-defined coordinates, and showed variable leads to lags. Data were fit by a rectified (temporal or phase of response; black curve superposed on open circle symbols of phase re: acceleration) cosine (amplitude of modulation) function (red curve in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> superposed on solid blue circle symbols of gain data). Note the rise and fall of gain in a cosine fashion as the fish&#x02019;s orientation was shifted from inter-aural accelerations to accelerations directed out the fish&#x02019;s snout or tail. The afferent was tested for nearly 360&#x000b0; change in orientation at 21 separate head angles. The fitted nulled value of 0 for Smin (e.g., Smin/Smax = 0 in the example in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) reflected the sharpness of directional tuning and the correspondence between tested (filled and open circles) and fitted (red and black curve) responses was sharp. Same afferent&#x02019;s responses to tilt stimuli at 2 Hz, &#x000b1;0.16&#x000b0; displacement, were recorded in a similar fashion at 23 separate orientations to determine Smax and Smin to tilt (D). Smax was 801 ips/&#x000b0; and nearly aligned to pure <italic>roll</italic> tilt as expected from the inter-aural responses to linear acceleration. Smin was near a complete null (32 ips/&#x000b0;) response predicted from the Smax to linear acceleration (yellow line) at both nose down (Pitch-N) and tail down (Pitch-T) pitch tilts, and the Smin/Smax ration was 0.04. Note the congruency between the responses to the two stimuli: Smax for linear acceleration (in C) was directed along the inter-aural axis out the right ear and Smax for tilt (in D) occurred at pure roll with right ear down. Similarly, Smin for linear acceleration occurred in forward or backward movements and Smin for tilts occurred in pure nose down or up pitches.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Uricular afferent response properties. <bold>(A)</bold> Recorded data of afferent response in control fish show IR modulation to sinusoidal linear acceleration at 2 Hz collected over time from 301 to 305.5 s.

In the absence of EVS activation the afferent had an averaged response modulation of &#x000b1;6.3 ips (&#x000b1;0.26 ips/cm/s<sup>2</sup> or &#x000b1;252 ips/g) centered about an IR of 7.2 ips that was temporarily altered by the brief epoch of EVS stimulation. When EVS action was less pronounced, afferent rate was elevated while at the same time its response modulation was decreased but not abolished.

Comparing the results in Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> it could be inferred that the early increase and later decrease in Smax was due to an OFF and On EVS action on the hair cell alone, respectively, without a direct action on the afferent. EVS action on afferent rate was almost exclusively excitatory (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) from the axo-dendritic synapse on the afferent and not through the axo-somatic synapse on the hair cell (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2009</xref>).

With only one exception, EVS pulses significantly elevated as expected the IR (EVS IR) above the MIR of background IR in all groups. The sole exception was the afferent group subjected to 32 days at 2.24 g (32D 2.24 g). Here, afferent response to EVS activation was noticeably infrequent with only 11.2% responding (against 37.2% in control afferents), and noticeably weaker with a difference of EVS to non-EVS epochs or IR (&#x00394;EVS) significantly less (6.9 &#x000b1; 14.9 ips) than that for control afferents (25.7 &#x000b1; 17.6 ips). These findings at the 32-day mark are not consistent with the significant Smax reduction (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the same vein, the afferent response to EVS pulses after 4 days at 2.24 g (4D 2.24 g) was more prevalent with 62.3% responding with significantly greater &#x00394;EVS (43.8 &#x000b1; 38.1 ips) than that for control afferents. These findings suggest that EVS action was greatly enhanced at 4-day mark, but again the action is not consistent with the significant Smax increase (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). At the present stage it is not possible to establish direct causality of afferent IR and response behavior after HG exposures and EVS action.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible Mechanism(s) of Afferent Adaptive Processes to Altered Gravity: Synaptic Remodeling</title><p>Afferent response sensitivity and hair cell synaptic organization were examined in the <italic>same</italic> animal to determine the possible causality between response magnitude and number of synaptic bodies.

As seen in other species toadfish utricular afferents showed a wide range of discharge rates, regularity of discharge, and response sensitivity to sinusoidal linear acceleration with a typically tight degree of directional selectivity.</p><p>The physical basis for differences in response dynamics among otolith afferents is not fully understood, and determining the precise signals originating from different regions of the utricular macula and how these signals enter central otolith reflex pathways have been a challenge. Afferent dendritic organization to the type of hair cell (type I and/or type II) it supplies varies in complexity (see review by <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2018</xref>), and it is reasonable to assume that hair cell excitation is not uniform (<xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Spoon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Curthoys et al., 2017</xref>). In chinchilla utricle about three-fourths of recorded afferents displayed a more regular discharge of their interspike intervals (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg et al., 1990a</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), and corresponds to about three-fourths the total area of macula designated as the medial extrastriola. Toadfish utricle is structurally similar in the broad sense to other species, including amniotes and other anamniotes, and its hair cell polarization is highly organized across the more 2D macula surface (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2018</xref>). Like the chinchilla, toadfish medial extrastriola occupies about three-fourths the total macula area (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and reflects the responses of the majority of afferents recorded in this study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Unlike the chinchilla, regularity of discharge of toadfish utricular afferents span a continuum but three-fourths of them are more irregularly discharging. An attractive hypothesis is that vestibular afferent inputs are matched to the dynamic requirements of the various reflexes they target (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Highstein et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">McArthur and Dickman, 2008</xref>), and evolutionary pressures drive the particular behaviors (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Straka and Baker, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Straka et al., 2014</xref>). In this scheme, the prevalent irregular utricular afferents are best matched to the control requirements of the rapid attack and escape avoidance of toadfish.</p><sec><title>Utricular Afferent Responses After Microgravity (&#x003bc;g) Exposure</title><p>From the earliest manned orbital missions we know that changes occur in processing of gravitational information during adaptation to microgram and re-adaptation to 1 g upon return to Earth. The adaptive mechanisms to altered gravity might be confined to the peripheral sensory structures or involve central processing centers or likely require the participation of both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Within the first day after STS-90 and -95 shuttle landings, a response hypersensitivity to acceleration stimuli was observed in utricular afferents (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>). Reduced gravity in orbit during these relatively short microgram exposures apparently resulted in an upregulation of afferent sensitivity. Time course of return to normal sensitivity in toadfish afferents paralleled the reported decrease in vestibular disorientation in astronauts after return from shuttle missions (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Reschke et al., 1994</xref>). Although belonging to a distinct group of animals, recordings taken directly from gravitoreceptors of the land snail (phylum Mollusca), and thus no intervening synapse as in afferent recordings, after exposures of 12&#x02013;16 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Balaban et al., 2011</xref>) and 30 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Aseyev et al., 2017</xref>) days in space also showed a pronounced response hypersensitivity to tilt. In a complimentary study in tilapia the gain of an otolith-related vestibuloocular reflex was significantly increased within the first postflight week, and returned to control levels in the second postflight week, of space missions (<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Sebastian et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Orbiting space stations provide a platform to extend human presence in space and capture the physiological response(s) to longer duration of exposures. <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Hallgren et al. (2016)</xref> measured in 1 g the ocular counterrolling (OCR), an otolith-mediated reflex, during centrifugation before and after a 6-month stay in space in 25 astronauts and found a significant reduction in OCR magnitude after landing and its restoration to normal levels in 9 days. Their results are largely in agreement with changes in gaze control reported by <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Kornilova et al. (2012)</xref> in cosmonauts to 129&#x02013;215 days in space. Adaptation to microgram is likely to change over time from an initial over compensation to restore normalcy to a hyposensitivity more in line with the prevailing gravity. Do the processes of adaptation to microgram in orbit or weightlessness in deep space missions reach a plateau or continue to evolve in time are questions yet to be answered.</p></sec><sec><title>Utricular Afferent Responses After Hypergravity Exposure</title><p>Based on the robustness of postflight hypersensitivity of utricular afferents, we expected to find a compensatory <italic>hyposensitivity</italic> in response to HG. The initial hypersensitivity was unexpected and developed at Day 3 and peaked at Day 4. It was followed by a period of normalcy and then the development of the anticipated hyposensitivity after 16&#x02013;32 days of HG. Initial hypersensitivity was robust and recovered to normal levels after &#x0223c;4&#x02013;6 days at 1 g. Utricular afferent response to HG did not reflect a systemic action on the labyrinth as a whole, since HC afferents were consistently normal in response and discharge properties and remained independent of level and duration of HG in the <italic>same</italic> fish. OCCs performed at 4- or 16-day exposure to 228&#x000b0;/s (38 rpm as in 2.24 g runs) constant angular velocity were identical in all measures to their utricular and canal afferent counterparts in non-rotated controls. Video taken during the light cycle did not reveal any aberrant behavior during the different exposures of 2.24 g, perhaps suggesting a central compensatory mechanism in operation. Of prime importance is the fact that in the same species we have the neural response to microgram and a more comprehensive evaluation of the neural response to HG. These results demonstrate that the utricle undergoes continuous plasticity based on magnitude of the prevailing gravity and suggest the possibility that the process of re-adaptation from HG exposure might mimic the process of adaptation to microgram.</p><p>The organism&#x02019;s response to transitions in gravity is not simply a step increase or decrease, but varies with time of exposure to the new level of force. Majority of astronauts experience mild-to-severe disorientation for 3&#x02013;4 days upon initial exposure to microgram, a condition akin to terrestrial motion sickness (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Reason and Brandt, 1975</xref>). Even though most humans eventually adapt after days to microgram, return to 1 g causes vestibular dysfunction (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Reschke et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Oman, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Black et al., 1999</xref>). The behavior (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Anken and Rahmann, 1998</xref>) and otolith afferent response sensitivity (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>) of fish follow a comparable course of readaptation after landing and therefore restoration to normalcy is likely a general reaction of the organism to short duration (weeks) exposure to microgram. Our data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>) confirm that readaptation also occurs in afferent response to HG.</p><p>The organism&#x02019;s early response to an abrupt change in the force of gravity is remarkable. In the Russian Cosmos/Bion missions many of the effects observed early in flight on vestibular and oculomotor function in nonhuman primates are consistent with response hypersensitivity. Badakva and Kozlovskaya summarized their results in <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al. (2005)</xref>. Within the first days in orbit gaze shifts to lateral visual targets were hypermetric, despite a reduction in head displacement. This hypermetria caused positional errors and was compensated by an increase in gain of the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) to 1.5 on Day 2 and remained high (2.0) up to Day 8. Associated with gaze hypermetria, response of vestibular nuclei neurons during gaze fixation task gradually increased to a maximum on Day 4, like our present HG data, and returned back to normal for the rest of the 1&#x02013;2 week flight. Gualierotti and colleagues (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Bracchi et al., 1975</xref>) directly addressed otolith afferent discharge in &#x003bc;G in technically challenging experiments in the bullfrog. Although the interpretation of their data is difficult, otolith afferent discharge appeared to increase within the first 3 days of the orbital mission and returned to normal at Day 5. Interestingly, this closes matches our HG data after exposure to 2.24 g. The initial reaction in astronauts and animals points to a possible common mechanism. Although it is clearly a speculation, the evidence suggests an exaggerated otolith reaction is evoked to a novel gravity challenge. This challenge occurs in either direction from a loss of gravity in spaceflight to an applied force by centrifugation on the ground. To what extent is this simply a transitory maladaptation or a behaviorally relevant response remains to be determined. Unfortunately, critical data in real-time targeting this initial response to microgram and HG remain lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms of Utricular Adaption to Gravity</title><p>We sought to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying utricular adaptation to transitions in gravity levels, particularly hair cell synaptic remodeling and EVS action. Observed changes are thought to reflect the following possibilities: (a) change in transducer sensitivity, (b) temporary structural alteration affecting mechanoreception, (c) pre- or post-synaptic alteration in the strength of synaptic transmission, or (d) neural feedback circuit or efferent copy switched on or off. We examined the latter two possibilities in detail and both attempts brought us no closer to identifying a clear mechanism that initiate and regulate adaptation.</p><p>(a) Transducer changes. Prolonged deviation of the sensory hair bundle leads to an adaptation of otolith hair cell receptor potentials (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Eatock et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg et al., 2012</xref>). Manifestation of this adaptation can be seen in responses of some otolith afferents to prolonged steps of linear acceleration (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez and Goldberg, 1976a</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Microgravity might be thought of as a step of hair bundle motion in the &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; direction, and adaptation in transducer mechanism(s) might negate any aberrant afferent response in microgram. The converse might occur in HG. The onset and time course of transducer adaptation might be both rapid and long-lasting, and involve a reconfiguration of the transmembrane channel (TMC)-like proteins of the transducer pore (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). Our data do not offer a clear insight.</p><p>(b) Structural changes of otolith mass. Otolith weight by gravity intensities might regulate the otoconia mass and alter its coupling to stereocilia in a manner that affects mechanotransduction, for example a change of otolith&#x02013;stereociliary coupling that adjusts bundle deflection for a given movement (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson-Hemsing et al., 2012</xref>). <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Wiederhold et al. (1997</xref>, <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) showed that the otolith mass in growing snails was increased by microgram exposure. A slowing in otolith growth during development was reported to occur under HG conditions in <italic>neonate</italic> fish (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Anken et al., 2000a</xref>), and also after vestibular nerve transection again in neonates (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Anken et al., 2000b</xref>). However, <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al. (1974)</xref> and <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Sondag et al. (1995)</xref> in well-controlled studies could not demonstrate any change in the otoconia Ca<sup>+2</sup> content, shape, size, or distribution in adult hamsters subjected to HG. More recently, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aceto et al. (2015)</xref> found a decrease in otolith calcification after prolonged HG exposure in zebrafish, presumably the result of a regulation of carbonic anhydrase and other matrix protein productions (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Anken et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Anken, 2006</xref>). As bone is adversely remodeled during space missions (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Demontis et al., 2017</xref>), calcium carbonate on the other hand might be deposited on existing otoconia to provide greater &#x0201c;weight&#x0201d; in an effort to restore the &#x0201c;gain&#x0201d; of gravity sensation; conversely, HG would lead to an ablation of otoconia mass to &#x0201c;rebalance&#x0201d; function. Our afferent recordings did not reveal any aberration(s) in discharge properties or spurious excitations except a change in response sensitivity, implying that if such a mechanism was in operation, the remodeling of the otolith mass was uniformly distributed. Although this mechanism is attractive, particularly for long-term habituation in a reduced gravity, we have no data collected in this study that directly addresses this mechanism.</p><p>(c) Synaptic plasticity. A widely considered candidate responsible in the adaptive response to microgram is plasticity of hair cell ribbon synapses (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Moser et al., 2006</xref>). The findings of <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Ross (2000)</xref> promoted this hypothesis: number of ribbon synapses in certain type II hair cells in rat was labile, increasing by approximately 55% following exposure to microgram; type I hair cells were less affected. Toadfish vestibular epithelia possess only type II hair cells and lack the specialized nerve calyx seen in reptiles, birds, and mammals. Also in toadfish the number of <italic>en passant</italic> and terminal boutons of a given semicircular canal afferent, indicating a potential locus for synaptic coupling to a hair cell, are positively correlated with its response sensitivity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 1991</xref>). Thus, an increase in ribbon synapses in rat utricular hair cells by microgram exposure aligns with our observed post-flight hypersensitivity in toadfish utricular afferents. However, more recent evidence by <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Sultemeier et al. (2017)</xref> in mouse exposed to 15 days of microgram paints a different picture. They found synapse densities <italic>decreased</italic>, not increased as seen by Ross, in medial extrastriola hair cells and remained unchanged elsewhere in other macula regions and HC cristae. Although one species is likely more susceptible to gravity influences than another based on body mass, this discrepancy between rat and mouse is intriguing but not readily apparent, and must be resolved in future studies. As we discuss below, the picture is even more blurred when we make a direct comparison between recorded response sensitivity and 3D serial reconstruction of synaptic bodies in individual hair cells in the <italic>same</italic> animal.</p><p>An important piece of relevant evidence is the time of synapse formation and reformation in inner ear structures. Turnover rate of ribbon synapses in vestibular hair cells is unknown, but some estimates derived from other systems are useful. Ribbon synapses in the visual system of albino rat are said to have a life span of &#x0223c;8 h (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Spadero et al., 1978</xref>) and are structurally plastic particularly in assembly and disassembly processes (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt and Drenckhahn, 1993</xref>) during development (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Regus-Leidig et al., 2009</xref>). In the hippocampus, asymmetric synapses form and disappear within a few minutes (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Desmond and Levy, 1986</xref>). Although related to different systems, these data indicate that specific times of synapse formation are from minutes to hours (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Cragg, 1969</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Cotman and Nieto-Sampedro, 1982</xref>). Further, <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Puro et al. (1977)</xref> showed that synapses not only turn over but that the rate of turnover increases during development, suggesting that both synapse formation and termination rates are regulated and that the specificity of synaptic connections can be increased by selective termination of synapses. Thus, as sensitivity is decreased to compensate for hyperstimulation, excess synapses will be deactivated by receptor downregulation and &#x0201c;anchors&#x0201d; inside the cell mark the former receptor sites (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">Ziff and Barry, 2002</xref>). Since the sudden change of gravity is an extreme condition, the specific time of synapse rearrangement might be expected to be longer: from hours to several days.</p><p>Despite the attractiveness of synaptic bodies being added or subtracted as needed to regulate the system response to gravity, a key finding here is in direct opposition to this hypothesis. In the <italic>same</italic> fish we recorded a substantial afferent population to acceleration in control fish and in fish after 4- or 16-day of 2.24 g exposures, and conducted complete 3D ultrastructural reconstructions of hair cells in the reversal zone of striola <italic>and</italic> in the predominant medial extrastriola region. Afferents had highly significant differences in Smax (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A</xref>) and average IR per cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11B</xref>) with virtually little to no overlap. Even with this clear distinction in utricular physiology, SB counts per hair cell were statistically equivalent in the selected three afferent populations in both macular regions <italic>measured in the same fish</italic>: hair cells contained on average five to six synaptic bodies, but the variation in number was large (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11C</xref>). Afferent Smax also showed a wide variation from less sensitive to highly sensitive within an individual animal, but were distinctly separated as a group from the other populations. The importance of this finding is that the physiological and anatomical results were obtained in the <italic>same</italic> animal, and no direct correlation was found. It might be argued that the utricular synaptic organization had adapted over the course of afferent recordings. We saw no indication of this: afferents after 4 and 16 days of HG were hyper- and hypo-sensitivity, respectively, from the start to the finish of the recordings and require days to readapt to 1 g. Clearly other factors might be in play. For example, adjustment of synaptic efficacy or strength might involve many processes other than the SB itself, such as Hebbian plasticity based on the correlation of pre- and post-synaptic cells (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Matsubara and Uehara, 2016</xref>). <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Suli et al. (2016)</xref> have provided some key insights into synaptic plasticity in mechanosensory hair cells. Using transgenic and mutant zebrafish lines they found that innervation was crucial for regulating the number, size, and localization of ribbons in maturing lateral line hair cells, and for their maintenance at the mature synapse. How synaptic weights and innervation patterns might scale up or down or fluctuate in distribution within the hair cell&#x02013;afferent complexes need to be examined in our model.</p><p>(d) A neural feedback circuit. It is remarkable that vertebrates exert an efferent (EVS) neural control over the sensitivity, bandwidth, and linearity of sound and motion sensation. In general, the EVS provides hair cell organs not only with the means to control passive filtering of sound and motion signals, but also to regulate the mechanical gain of the living amplifiers in the ear (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Hudspeth, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Rabbitt and Brownell, 2011</xref>). Efferent cell bodies are located in the caudal brainstem, a phylogenetically ancient structure that monitors and controls vital functions including alertness and arousal. A typical efferent neuron in toadfish has extensive dendritic arbors spanning the brainstem, thereby providing the neuron the capability to receive a wealth of descending command and ascending sensory information (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Highstein and Baker, 1986</xref>; confirmed in the present study, <italic>q.v.</italic> Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">3</xref>). Spatial coding is likely not selective, since efferent fibers can innervate multiple end organs on one side or even bifurcate within the brain to innervate both labyrinths (<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Eden and Correia, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Strutz, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Dechesne et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Highstein and Baker, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Valli et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Dickman and Correia, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Fujino et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Marco et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Birinyi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Chi et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Does the EVS participate in the adaptive processes observed after exposures to HG? We addressed this question indirectly in this study by (1) inferring EVS action on the hair cell by comparing Smax observed in each experimental group (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), (2) inferring EVS action on the afferent by comparing average IR at Smax (IR, in ips/cycle) observed in each experimental group (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and (3) pairing the MIR (in ips) with and without EVS stimulation in absence of acceleration in the same afferent in each experimental group (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A more direct measure to determine EVS role in neural adaptation was sought, but not found. For example, axons presumed to originate from efferent neurons were too infrequently encountered and their discharge had no clear variants to permit a meaningful comparison among subjects within or across groups, and the EVS action on afferent sensitivity to acceleration stimuli via its influence on hair cell receptor potential could not be normalized in any meaningful manner, mostly due to the variability in EVS efficacy and frequency of occurrence within each fish.</p><p>Efferent vestibular system functional role in nonmammalian vertebrates is likely linked to innate behaviors, such as attack and feeding and escape and aversives established for survival of the animal and its reproduction. In toadfish these actions are preceded by a stereotypic behavior, and it is powerfully evoked during the anticipatory phase of production of large, self-generated, and behaviorally relevant movements (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Boyle and Highstein, 1984</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1990b</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Highstein and Baker, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">Tricas and Highstein, 1990</xref>, <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). EVS regulation of afferent sensitivity is likely through its action on hair cell modulation (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Flock and Russell, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Rabbitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Rohmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Poppi et al., 2018</xref>). A novel finding supporting the importance of behavioral context in EVS function was recently reported by <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Chagnaud et al. (2015)</xref>. In a semi-isolated preparation, which permits identifying the source of incoming signals, of larval <italic>Xenopus</italic> it was shown corollary discharge signals arising from the spinal central pattern generator cyclically modulated efferent neurons during fictive swimming. During these phasic epochs of efferent signaling, there was a corresponding gain reduction of afferent responses to vestibular-related stimuli. Thus, similar to toadfish, the EVS of <italic>Xenopus</italic> can effectively optimize sensory processing.</p><p>No presumed efferent neurons were encountered in the utricular nerve that consistently responded to applied otolith (linear acceleration or body roll/pitch) or canal (yaw rotation or head down/up pitch) stimuli. Given their low discharge at rest and disregard to benign vestibular stimulation, as well as the powerful excitation during preparatory behaviors, efferent neurons likely provide more episodic control over their synaptic targets and not a tonic influence. Recent evidence showed that the EVS could influence VOR plasticity using the &#x003b1;9 knockout mouse model, particularly after destruction of one labyrinth (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000fc;bner et al., 2017</xref>). Although in a classical sense the EVS might still provide an underlying tonic drive to its targets, for the sake of argument in the present context a drive that also monitors the prevailing gravity condition, it does not provide cross-talk between otoliths and canals for continuous passive stimuli or influence the output during benign and nonthreatening volitional movements. Viewed from this perspective the EVS endows the toadfish with a powerful means to adjust the sensitivity and dynamic range of motion sensation, and is positioned to monitor prevailing conditions and regulate the gravity sensation (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Kondrachuk and Boyle, 2006</xref>). However, no direct measurements or indirect inferences from afferent discharge behavior were found here to suggest a clear EVS role in regulating the utricular response to altered gravity. The information content provided by the efferent feedback signal in diverse conditions may be more complex and involve a novel self-regulation of synapses induced by changes in <italic>input</italic> signals in altered gravity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
