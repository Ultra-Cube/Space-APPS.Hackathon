The standard of snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen is not always practical or possible. RNAlater, a concentrated solution of ammonium and cesium sulfates, has become a standard preservative in the absence of liquid nitrogen. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RNAlater in preserving both RNA and proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> tissues for use in RNAseq and LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins. While successful in preserving plant material, a transcriptomic and proteomic response is evident. Specifically, 5770 gene transcripts, 84 soluble proteins, and 120 membrane-bound proteins were found to be differentially expressed at a log-fold change of &#x000b1;1 (P &#x02264; 0.05). This response is mirrored in the abundance of post-translational modifications, with 23 of the 108 (21.3%) phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance at a log-fold change of &#x000b1;1 (P &#x02264; 0.05). While RNAlater is effective in preserving biological information, our findings warrant caution in its use for transcriptomic and proteomic experiments.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNX13AM48G</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wyatt</surname><given-names>Sarah E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was partially funded by NASA (#NNX13AM48G to SEW and DRL) with supplemental funding provided by NASA GeneLab.

The ability to accurately preserve samples prior to extraction provides researchers flexibility with experimental design. Snap freezing in liquid nitrogen has been the standard technique for molecular and cell biologists and provides ideal preservation of proteins and nucleic acids for long periods when stored at -80&#x000b0;C. However, field experiments, remote regions of the world, and areas with insufficient infrastructure to allow for access to liquid nitrogen necessitate the use of fixatives [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>RNAlater contains high concentrations of quaternary ammonium sulfates and cesium sulfates which denature RNases, DNases and proteases to prevent the degradation of RNA [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While RNAlater is ineffective in the preservation of fine anatomical and structural features [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], it has been shown to be effective in the preservation of nucleic acids [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. RNAlater has been used to successfully preserve high quality DNA for up to 7 years from the date of sample collection and fixation in chimpanzee fecal material collected from remote habitats [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Parallel studies of RNAlater and formalin fixation on these fecal samples demonstrated RNAlater to be the superior fixative for the preservation of nucleic acids. In the past decade, studies on human tissues [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and microbes [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have shown that, in addition to nucleic acids, RNAlater is effective at preserving proteins. Saito et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] analyzed microbial proteins and showed that more proteins were detected in RNAlater preserved samples than in the snap frozen controls. Bennike et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] demonstrated protein and RNA integrity, and detection of post-translational modifications are not significantly impacted by RNAlater in human tissue samples.</p><p>RNAlater has been used for the preservation of plant material as well&#x02014;especially space flown material grown aboard the international space station [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the structure of plant tissues present challenges for the use of fixatives, and how the cell wall impacts permeability of the fixative is unclear. Herein, we present, to our knowledge, the first full &#x02018;omics level study performed to determine the ability of RNAlater to preserve tissue of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the primary model organism for plants, for downstream &#x02018;omics-level analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>RNAlater treatment alters transcript levels in Arabidopsis seedlings</title><p>One caution with using RNAlater is the rate of its diffusion through tissues that could lead to uneven preservation of cells across tissues. Because RNAlater denatures transcriptional machinery, uneven preservation across tissues could lead to a transcriptomic or proteomic response. To determine if RNAlater treatment impacted transcript levels in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, etiolated seedlings were grown for 72 hours then either snap frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, or Incubated for 12 h in RNAlater at room temperature followed by freezing at -80&#x000b0;C. RNAseq was performed and transcripts compared to assess differential gene expression. Between 17 and 30 million read pairs for each biological replicate were aligned to the TAIR10 assembly using STAR. For each replicate, at least 27,000 unique genes were detected using HTSeq, with at least 15,000 per replicate at greater than 5 counts per million. The ribosomal fraction was below 2% in all replicates.</p><p>Transcriptional activities in Arabidopsis were found to be modified by the method of preservation. At a log-fold change cutoff of &#x000b1;1 (P &#x02264; 0.05), 5770 gene transcripts were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175943.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). More stringent log-fold change and significance cutoffs also identified transcripts that show differential regulation. We selected the 5770 as a robust number for subsequent analysis. A gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified several upregulated categories indicating a transcript level response to osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175943.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Together, these results suggest that RNAlater preservation is not immediate in etiolated seedlings, and allows time for transcriptional response to osmotic stress caused by ammonium sulfates and cesium sulfates, resulting in potentially altered transcriptomes.</p><fig id="pone.0175943.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0175943.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Number of differentially expressed genes identified by RNAseq analysis.</title><p>A) the number of transcripts differentially expressed in RNAlater compared to liquid N<sub>2</sub> shown by log-fold change (base two) and p-value cutoffs and B) the log fold enrichment of the GO terms for biological processes enriched for the 5770 transcript IDs differentially expressed at log-fold change &#x000b1;1 (p &#x02264; 0.05).

The solution denatures proteases and RNases to preserve RNA and protein integrity for downstream analysis. While many studies have successfully utilized RNAlater as a preservative, few studies have directly compared the effects of this fixative on stability of RNA, protein and post-translational modifications. Bennike et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] compared formalin, RNAlater and snap-freezing of human colon mucosal biopsies in a quantitative proteomics study which demonstrated RNAlater yielded the most similar results to liquid nitrogen. Additionally, the percentage of modified peptides detected was stable between RNAlater and snap-frozen samples. Specific amidation and oxidation events were not altered between liquid nitrogen and RNAlater fixation in human tissues [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Saito et al. [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] performed a comparison of snap-frozen samples to five preservative solutions (SDS-extraction buffer, ethanol, trichloroacetic acid, B-PER, and RNAlater) on the proteome integrity of cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus</italic> WH8102 and found that, after four weeks of preservation, RNAlater was the superior preservative and did not significantly alter the proteome compared to snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. In the 20 most abundant proteins in this microbe, the average relative abundance in RNAlater samples compared to liquid nitrogen samples was 1.01, indicating retention of protein integrity [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. No equivalent control had been performed using plant tissues to examine the effects of RNAlater on plant proteomics nor to investigate transcriptomic modifications induced by the preservative.</p><p>Here, we show that fixation with RNAlater did not affect quality or quantity of proteins identified in Arabidopsis seedlings, consistent with previous studies using animal and bacterial tissue [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, RNAlater treatment led to altered gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175943.g001">Fig 1</xref>), protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175943.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and abundance of post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0175943.t001">Table 1</xref>). RNAlater had a substantial impact on the transcriptome, with 5770 transcripts differentially expressed at a log-fold change &#x000b1;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175943.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). If the preserved tissue was responding to RNAlater, one would predict that the ammonium sulfates and cesium sulfates in the mixture would induce expression of genes related to salt stress. Indeed, genes associated with desiccation and osmotic homeostasis were the most enriched categories, suggesting that the transcript differences are a result of a cellular response to RNAlater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175943.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), potentially caused by an uneven preservation of cells as RNAlater diffuses across a tissue. Of the proteins detected, less than 1.4% of the membrane and soluble proteins, 120 and 84 respectively, were found to be altered between treatments at a log-fold change &#x000b1;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175943.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>). A GO enrichment analysis of the differentially abundant proteins did not indicate a salt stress response that could be attributed to the effects of RNAlater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175943.g002">Fig 2B and 2D</xref>). The absolute detection of post-translational modifications was unchanged by RNAlater, with the exception of peptides corresponding to four proteins&#x02014;ROC4 (AT3G62030), an ATP synthase beta-subunit (AT5G08670), as well as CRUCIFERIN 1 and 3 (AT4G28520 and AT5G44120) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0175943.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0175943.s002">S2</xref> Tables). Cruciferins are the most abundant seed storage proteins in Arabidopsis seedlings and have been implicated in response to oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0175943.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The modifications may be a direct result of the oxidative stress produced by the ammonium salts and may indicate potential mechanism for the cruciferin protein&#x02019;s ability to buffer seeds from oxidative stress. While the absolute detection of the remaining modifications was unaltered, the abundance of protein modifications was more sensitive to RNAlater fixation. Phosphorylation events were the most sensitive with 17.24% of the phosphorylated soluble proteins and 22.78% of the phosphorylated membrane proteins exhibiting an altered abundance of phosphorylated peptides. Deamidation and oxidation events were less sensitive to RNAlater (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0175943.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the drastic alterations in transcript levels were not mirrored in the proteome. While transcription can be quickly initiated in response to a change in environment, a change in translation would be slower and dependent on new transcripts. Thus, the rate of tissue infiltration allows a short-term alteration in transcription, but the RNAlater successfully inhibits the translational machinery before a substantial amount of protein is produced or degraded. The idea of a brief period of cellular response, prior to full fixation by RNAlater, is also supported by the observed changes in protein modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175943.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these data suggest that researchers should use caution when selecting RNAlater as a fixative for plant omics-level experiments. Although it is convenient, depending on the sample, it may be unable to effectively halt transcriptional processes rapidly enough to prevent a transcriptomic response to the fixative. Theoretically, experimental controls, also fixed in RNAlater, would eliminate differential expression caused by the RNAlater-induced transcripts, preventing misidentification. However, some legitimate expression changes induced by experimental conditions could be obscured by RNAlater induction of the same genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Plant material</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.)
