However, how male and female muscle may respond differently to micro- and partial-gravity environments is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to micro and partial gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fisher rats (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0200b;=&#x000a0;&#x0200b;120) underwent either castration/ovariectomy or sham surgeries. After two weeks recovery, animals were divided into microgravity (0g), partial-gravity (40% of weight bearing, 0.4g), or full weight bearing (1g) interventions for 28 days. Measurements of muscle size and strength were evaluated prior to and after interventions. At 0g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle size compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Additionally, at 0.4g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle strength compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Females have greater musculoskeletal aberrations during exposure to both microgravity and partial-gravity environments; these differences are not dependent on the presence of sex steroid hormones. Correspondingly, additional interventions may be necessary to mitigate musculoskeletal loss in female astronauts to protect occupational and overall health.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sex differences</kwd><kwd>Atrophy</kwd><kwd>Muscle strength</kwd><kwd>Plantar flexion</kwd><kwd>Dorsiflexion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="nomen0010"><title>Abbreviations list</title><def-list><def-item><term id="d0010">1g</term><def><p id="p0010">Simulated Earth gravity, normal weight bearing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0015">0.4g</term><def><p id="p0015">Simulated Martian gravity, 40% of normal weight bearing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0020">0g</term><def><p id="p0020">Simulated micro-gravity, 0% normal weight bearing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0025">NASA</term><def><p id="p0025">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0030">ISS</term><def><p id="p0030">International Space Station</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0035">ARED</term><def><p id="p0035">Advanced Resistive Exercise Device</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0040">CAST</term><def><p id="p0040">Castrated rats</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0045">OVX</term><def><p id="p0045">Ovariectomized rats</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0050">Sham</term><def><p id="p0050">Sham (placebo) surgery in rats, intact gonads</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0055">PBS</term><def><p id="p0055">Phosphate Buffered Saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0060">IACUC</term><def><p id="p0060">Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0065">M</term><def><p id="p0065">Males</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0070">F</term><def><p id="p0070">Females</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0075">Hz</term><def><p id="p0075">Hertz</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0080">pQCT</term><def><p id="p0080">Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0085">mm</term><def><p id="p0085">Millimeters</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0090">mm/s</term><def><p id="p0090">Millimeters per second</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0095">SAS</term><def><p id="p0095">Statistical Analysis System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0100">LSMESTIMATE</term><def><p id="p0100">Least Squared Means Estimate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0105">PROC MIXED</term><def><p id="p0105">Procedure Mixed</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0110">ANOVA</term><def><p id="p0110">Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0115">&#x003bc;m</term><def><p id="p0115">micrometer</p></def></def-item></def-list></sec><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0120">Skeletal muscle strength is critical for operational health and safety for astronauts upon the International Space Station and future missions to the Moon and Mars. Exposure to microgravity (or microgravity analogs) is well known to elicit musculoskeletal alterations in humans and in rodent models.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> To mitigate these losses, NASA has instigated strict requirements for exercise interventions on the International Space Station (ISS). However, these interventions are time-consuming (&#x0223c;2&#x000a0;&#x0200b;h /day) and do not fully mitigate musculoskeletal losses.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Additionally, while certain exercise modalities are available on the ISS, such as the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) and a specialized treadmill system, given the space limitations for the upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon and future missions to Mars, exercise may not be a viable option for early expeditions to such locations. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of musculoskeletal physiology will be necessary to develop other interventions to mitigate micro- and partial gravity-induced alterations to muscle health.</p><p id="p0125">One of the key areas of interest for astronaut health is to ensure a thorough understanding of biological sex differences during exposure to reduced gravity environments. While prior crewed missions may have been disproportionally male, the current Artemis class of astronauts is 50% male and 50% female.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Additionally, commercial spaceflight appears to be quickly becoming a reality, with future customers of this enterprise likely comprising approximately 50% males and 50% females. Therefore, understanding the influence of biological sex on muscle outcomes is imperative to developing interventions for safe space travel.</p><p id="p0130">Recent articles have detailed baseline differences in male and female muscle fiber type distribution and metabolic activity.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Disuse atrophy is known to differentially influence different fiber types, providing physiological plausibility for sex differences in the etiology of disuse atrophy. One of the key experimental models for investigating spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal deteriorations is hindlimb unloading, which entails rodents being elevated from their cage floors by their tail or hip harness. This position completely removes gravitational loading from the rodents&#x02019; back paws and elicits a fluid shift towards the head, similar to spaceflight. Extensive literature has been published using this model, which has been elegantly described in previous reviews.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Experimental research using hindlimb unloading to investigate the influence of biological sex on the progression of musculoskeletal deficits after disuse have been conflicting. One study noted that female rats better maintained muscle function compared to males after 14 days of unloading.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In contrast, others have found female mice had exacerbated muscle loss compared to males within seven days of unloading.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> These phenotypic differences were accompanied by a relatively greater reactive oxygen species induction, greater autophagy induction, and lower protein synthetic rates in females compared to males.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Moreover, an additional study found that female mice responded more favorably to mitochondrially-targeted catalase as a therapy to mitigate disuse, compared to males.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> However, it should be noted that others have not found mitochondrially-targeted catalase to mitigate disuse-associated atrophy in either males or females.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p id="p0135">One key difference between males and females is differences in major circulating sex steroid hormones, with testosterone being a key sex steroid hormone for males and estradiol being a key sex steroid hormone for females. A comprehensive review of each of these hormones&#x02019; function in relation to muscle health is beyond the scope of this paper and has been detailed elsewhere<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>; however, it is clear that both hormones are important for muscle size and strength. What is uncertain is if these steroid hormones contribute to sex differences in musculoskeletal losses during atrophy, or conversely if these hormones potentially mask inherent musculoskeletal differences between males and females. Understanding the influence of sex steroid hormones on muscle loss is important for understanding basic muscle physiology as well as possibly developing interventions to mitigate muscle loss for astronauts.</p><p id="p0140">The aggregate of the studies to date is far from a consensus on how or if females may respond differently to a micro- or partial-gravity environment. Moreover, considering the timeline of prior studies (0&#x02013;14 days of disuse), questions remain on whether sex differences exist, and if they would persist with longer durations of unloading. Additionally, while mechanistic studies investigating alterations in cellular signaling are undoubtedly critical for an in-depth understanding of muscle biology, they do not address whether the muscle will have different functional capacity after exposure to micro- or partial-gravity. Alterations to muscle function will be imperative for NASA to determine how to optimize operational effectiveness and safety in the astronaut corps.</p><p id="p0145">Overall, sex differences in the etiology of muscle loss have not been fully resolved. Moreover, how sex steroid hormones may act to augment or mitigate sex differences during disuse atrophy has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine if and how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments in male and female rats.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Animal experiments</title><p id="p0150"><italic>Overall design:</italic> All experimental procedures were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol number: 081&#x02013;2020).

At 12 weeks of age, the rats underwent either castration/ovariectomy (CAST/OVX) or sham (SHAM) surgeries. Animals were given two weeks to recover; thereafter, they were divided into either simulated micro-gravity (0g), simulated partial-gravity (40% of bodyweight, Martian gravity, 0.4g) or Earth gravity control (1g) conditions. Simulated 0g was induced with a pelvic harness around the animals&#x02019; hips to keep hindlimbs suspended from the ground, as we have previously described.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Simulated 0.4g was induced with a harness and vest system to allow the animal to keep all paws on the ground with reduced loading, as we have previously described.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Partial weight-bearing was assessed weekly and adjusted as needed to maintain 40% weight bearing. A total of 10 rats were used in each group. Animals remained in interventions for 28 days. Immediately prior to and after interventions, animals underwent a series of tests to evaluate changes in musculoskeletal strength (detailed below). After post-intervention testing, animals were euthanized with 30%&#x02013;70% carbon dioxide of chamber volume per minute. Death was confirmed with cardiac puncture. These procedures are aligned with 2020 American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines on Euthanasia guidelines. Hindlimb muscles were then collected and weighed. Soleus muscles were fixed in 10% formalin for 48&#x000a0;&#x0200b;h and rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for histological analysis.

Rats were fed standard laboratory chow throughout the study. Food was weighed daily to ensure appropriate consumption. Animals were also checked daily to ensure the harness was functioning appropriately and weighed weekly to ensure they did not have excessive bodyweight loss. If an animal exhibited extreme signs of stress (&#x0003e; 20% bodyweight loss, anorexia, non-grooming behaviors, etc.), it was removed from the study and euthanized. One rat (M-CAST-0.4g) was removed from the study due to excessive bodyweight loss.</p><p id="p0160"><italic>Grip Strength:</italic> Hindlimb grip strength was evaluated as we have previously described.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Briefly, animals&#x02019; hindlimbs were placed on a grip bar attached to a force transducer (Ametek, Berwyn, PA).

The animal's tibial nerve was stimulated to elicit either dorsiflexion or plantar flexion. To confirm appropriate needle placement, a small (10&#x000a0;&#x0200b;Hz) stimulation was applied to the nerve. After appropriate needle placement was confirmed, a 200&#x000a0;&#x0200b;Hz stimulation for 200&#x000a0;&#x0200b;ms was applied to the nerve generating a maximal tetanus.

Cross-sectional data (e.g., muscle fiber areas and tissue weights) were analyzed as percent difference from within sex and hormonal status (SHAM, CAST/OVX) 1g controls. A covariate of baseline values was used for longitudinal data to account for the possible influence of baseline values on the progression of muscle loss. Percent differences were used to more directly compare data between males and females despite their significant differences in bodyweight and other muscle parameters. The specific research question was to evaluate differences between males and females at different simulated gravitational loads (0g and 0.4g) and in response to different gonadal status (SHAM or OVX/CAST).

Fischer) may play a role in the differences noted between our study and the prior work. First, Wistar rats are outbred strains of rats compared to Fischer rats, which are inbred. Theoretically, inbred animals should have reduced genetic variability and hence less variability. However, recent works have demonstrated inbred rats strains to overall have greater genetic variation than would be expected in inbred rat strains.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> There has been extensive debate on the scientific validity and utility of outbred vs. inbred strains,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> which is beyond the direct scope of this investigation. Regarding which strain is a more accurate representation of humans, it is difficult to directly speculate based on the current data. However, given there is human data to complement the current study,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> it is at minimum physiologically plausible the Fischer rat is an appropriate recapitulation of human physiology for the current investigation.</p><p id="p0305">Differences between males and females can be inherently difficult to analyze and interpret as males are typically larger than females; therefore, comparing means or raw change scores may hide potential sex differences. Moreover, because males tend to be larger from the initiation of the study, baseline measurements may interact with the overall trajectory of muscle loss. It would not be feasible to match males and females on body weight or muscle strength at the initiation of the study as that would result in either males being smaller than average for their age or females being larger than average for their age. Therefore, for this study we opted to utilize a relative change score (percent change) and account for baseline differences with a covariate. We believe this analysis strategy allows for more robust conclusions regarding the influence of sex on the progression of muscle loss during exposure to micro- and partial gravity environments. To facilitate this method of analysis for future researchers, we have included our statistical code used for the study in supplementary files.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p id="p0310">It is noteworthy that many of the sex differences we saw between males and females were present to a greater extent at 0.4g compared to 0g. We postulate the 0g intervention is a more severe stimulus, which will likely maximize musculoskeletal losses, regardless of sex. At 0g, it is possible that males and females have both maximized the physiologically possible muscle loss due to disuse, which may have concealed potential sex differences. In contrast, exposure to 0.4g, which is a comparatively milder stimulus, allowed for the presentation of subtle differences between males and females undergoing disuse. We assert that this partial weight-bearing model may be an ideal model to study the subtle nuances between males and females and susceptibility to disuse atrophy. Specific to NASA, with the forthcoming Artemis missions and goal of building a base on the Moon, sex differences are extremely relevant. Terrestrially, rarely do muscle immobilizations involve a complete unloading of the tissue; therefore, partial weight-bearing may be a more relevant model for investigating musculoskeletal responses to disuse and how biological sex may interact with these responses.</p><p id="p0315">Applying our rodent model to humans, our data imply female astronauts are likely to experience greater relative musculoskeletal loss and likely prolonged recovery compared to male counterparts upon exposure to micro- and partial-gravity environments. One well-known countermeasure to mitigate micro-gravity induced musculoskeletal deterioration is exercise, which is currently part of the standard of care for astronauts on the ISS. Recent meta-analysis suggests comparable exercise adaptations to males and females with resistance exercise.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> These findings in combination with our results may suggest females require slightly more resistance exercise to mitigate the effects of micro- or partial-gravity environments. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tests and warrants further study. Additionally, while this study did not specifically evaluate muscle recovery after exposure to reduced mechanical loading, it is expected, given the greater reduction in muscle size and strength, that females would have a more prolonged recovery relative to males. Estradiol is known to be an important regulator of regenerative capacity in females.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> The interaction between a low estrogen state during micro- or partial-gravity and inherently greater muscle loss in female astronauts may create a &#x0201c;double hit&#x0201d; effect on skeletal muscle, whereby muscle regeneration and recovery are prolonged. Practically, this could result in increased occupational risk for female astronauts after long-duration space flights; therefore, additional interventions may be necessary to either mitigate muscle loss in female astronauts or facilitate recovery upon return to Earth. Terrestrially, conditions that result in muscle disuse and estradiol alterations may be particularly exacerbated in females and may require longer recovery periods.</p><p id="p0320">We must acknowledge a few limitations to the current investigation. Gonadectomy removes many other hormones other than simply androgens and estrogens. Therefore, it is possible lack of other hormones produced be sex organs many have influenced our results in possibly unpredictable ways. Additionally, our study used fairly young (14 weeks of age) rats, corresponding approximately to young adult age. Considering the average age for astronauts is approximately 45 years of age,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> it is possible using younger animals may not fully recapitulate a slightly older human population. Finally, we were only able to model mechanical unloading associated with spaceflight. Space travel is associated with multiple environmental stressors such as space radiation, sleep disturbances and others. Therefore, it is conceivable these other variables may interact with micro- or partial-gravity to alter our conclusions regarding the influence of biological sex and muscle loss. Regardless, we believe our current data provides valuable information on the ramifications of micro- and partial-gravity environments to musculoskeletal function in males and females.</p><p id="p0325">In conclusion, we have demonstrated female rats have greater loss in muscle size and strength compared to male rats after exposure to long-duration partial or full unloading. These differences are conserved regardless of the presence or absence of sex hormones. However, given the discrepancy of the current investigation compared to prior works,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> more research is likely needed to fully evaluate the influence of biological sex on disuse-induced muscle loss. If these results prove analogous for humans, it is likely that females are at increased risk for adverse muscle and related functional outcomes after exposure to reduced gravitation. Given the potential future of spaceflight, both scientific and commercial, more research is necessary to better understand risks and potential preventive therapies of muscle loss and approaches for accelerating recovery. Importantly, since, based on this rat data, females have accelerated muscle loss during exposure to micro- or partial-gravity environments, interventions to mitigate these losses may need to be sex-specific in order to ensure astronaut safety and future mission successes.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Submission statement</title><p id="p0330">The authors certify that the submitted manuscript has not been published previously, is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, and if accepted will not be published elsewhere without the written consent of the copy-write holder.
