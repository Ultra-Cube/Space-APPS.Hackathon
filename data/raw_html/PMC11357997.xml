However, with the emergence of private space programmes and broadening access to orbital missions, new opportunities for research and discovery have emerged for civilian engagement with spaceflight. Specifically, SpaceX has now launched or announced several privately supported missions, including the all-civilian Inspiration4 mission&#x000a0;and the Polaris Dawn series of missions (including on Starship). These missions enable a broader representation of astronaut cohorts, spanning a wider range of ages (for example, the youngest American astronaut, Hayley Arceneaux), balanced representation of sexes, diverse genetic and medical backgrounds, as well as opportunities for new science, technology, art and public engagement during their missions.</p><p id="Par4">Here we present findings from the human research experiments performed on SpaceX&#x02019;s first all-civilian private spaceflight, Inspiration4, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on 15 September 2021, on the SpaceX <italic>Crew Dragon</italic> capsule. This orbital class mission reached 590.6&#x02009;km in altitude; the farthest distance crewed orbital missions have been into space since the Gemini programme. Although the crew spent only 3&#x02009;days in low Earth orbit, they experienced similar hazards of spaceflight as International Space Station (ISS) missions (often 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;months in duration), including radiation exposure, sustained microgravity, the closed and hostile environment of space, isolation and confinement, and long distance from Earth resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Thus, the Inspiration4 mission, and similar missions, provide a platform to study these acute exposures endemic to low Earth orbit, with unique data collection opportunities in the earliest phase of the human body&#x02019;s response to spaceflight.</p><p id="Par5">The three main objectives of the research projects deployed on the Inspiration4 mission were to (1) evaluate the feasibility of collecting biological and behavioural data in an all-civilian crew throughout pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight phases of the spaceflight mission, (2) examine the biological and behavioural responses of the crew to short-duration orbital spaceflight and (3) build the foundation for a biomedical database and enable access to these biomedical data from the crew and mission. The Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to test the feasibility of medical research aboard a commercial spaceflight mission crewed by non-professional astronauts, as well as new clinical and research protocols, which spanned a wide range of assays and experiments (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Specifically, the Multimodal Evaluation of Spaceflight Health protocol for the Inspiration4 mission from the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) funded multiple investigators to conduct separate yet related investigations on the Inspiration4 mission, and deployed a battery of tests to understand some of the major effects of short-duration spaceflight on humans, including portable ultrasound measurements, cognitive and sensorimotor tests, surveys, physiological data collected with a smartwatch and blood/saliva testing. Moreover, a comprehensive Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) protocol, based on the NASA Twins Study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, was used to measure multi-omic, clinical and immune profiles in whole blood, serum, plasma, saliva and biopsied skin samples. In this Article, we present and discuss the key findings from studies evaluating the Inspiration4 crew&#x02019;s comprehensive multi-omics analyses of biospecimens, ultrasound imaging, otolith function, cardiovascular physiology and cognitive performance, which together enable an in-depth biomedical research approach for private crews on upcoming missions and unprecedented access to these data and samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Multi-omic profiling of the Inspiration4 crew</title><p id="Par6">Building upon established omics, sample pipelines and analytic methods from the NASA Twins Study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, we collected samples for an integrative multi-omics analysis of the Inspiration4 crew (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Assessment of cross-reactivity and specificity showed no significant non-specific binding, with a minimal background sometimes visible for IgM (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were less than 20% (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), and the presence of some high-level outliers was the result of a low spatial distribution homogeneity that was compensated by measurement repeatability (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).

Moreover, this mission also enabled new biomedical metrics for spaceflight, such as RNA methylation, single-nucleus chromatin, single-cell expression metrics and spatial transcriptomics. Overall, this work demonstrated that a diverse civilian crew can conduct scientific experiments, process samples and significantly contribute to spaceflight research with minimal risk.

The choice of targets was motivated by high-priority concerns and risks reported over the years of ISS missions. For example, flow anomalies in the IJV (for example, severe stasis, flow reversal) frequently develop in ISS crew members in the later stages of long-duration spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>; however, such alterations in cardiovascular function have been less studied in the earlier days of spaceflight when precursors to cardiovascular risks may begin to emerge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In the Inspiration4 mission, IJV flow anomalies were not observed in any of the four astronauts, suggesting that flow anomalies develop later in-flight. The lack of IJV flow anomalies also diverge from Earth-based simulations of microgravity (head-down tilt), which demonstrate IJV and other vascular alterations after five days of exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. If corroborated by future studies in short-duration spaceflight, this finding may further our understanding of the mechanisms and progression pattern of flow degradation in the left IJV during sustained microgravity. Inspiratory resistance reduced right IJV CSA by an average of 36% pre-flight (supine) and 29% in-flight but did not reach statistical significance in this small cohort of astronauts. This trend suggests facilitated IJV drainage due to resistance breathing, and the experiment demonstrated a simplified in-flight screening method, with resistance breathing as an option to correct anomalous IJV flow. Overall, these findings bode well for the cardiovascular safety profile of short-duration missions, although future studies that address other anatomical targets are needed, as the effects of spaceflight are not uniform throughout the cardiovascular system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Probing the potential limitations of miniaturized ultrasound technology combined with the rapid deployment and complete crew autonomy was an inseparable part of the experiment. This autonomy is in stark contrast to the ISS experience, where all imaging sessions are conducted with a traditional device and in real-time interaction with experts in the mission control centre. The anatomical and technical quality of the images, expressed as overall success scores, appeared inversely related to the complexity of the autonomous procedures. Bladder imaging (the simplest procedure) and IJV imaging (intermediate difficulty and complexity) each had similar scores, well above the usability threshold. Conversely, the ocular imaging procedure (most intricate), which required precise gaze control and accurate probe manipulation by real-time visual feedback, did not produce image sets of sufficient quality to derive the intended measures, such as globe axial length or optic nerve sheath diameter. In this study, all but the most intricate procedures could be successfully performed by minimally trained users with the aid of appropriate JIT materials. Based on these findings, as well as those acquired during similar applications on the ISS, ocular imaging with JIT instruction in future missions should involve a dedicated ultrasound operator; however, other exams can be reliably performed in self-scanning, autonomous mode, which represents a significant medical and research capability in situations with degraded communications (for example, high latency, loss of communication). Payloads consisting of a miniaturized imaging system with an intuitive interface can enable future experiments featuring short lead and training times, rapid deployment, flexible schedules and data collection autonomy, which will enable scientific research opportunities even on the most constrained of spaceflight missions.</p><p id="Par22">Studying ocular misalignment and otolith symmetry in short-duration spaceflight is not without caveats.

Although the total sample of <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 astronauts is small, it is not inconsistent with previous studies of astronaut cognitive performance in spaceflight. While data collection spaceflight is challenging and limited by numerous factors (for example, cost, limited time and access to astronauts), longitudinal sampling of measures within and across mission phases can promote statistical power (Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This study did not have age- and sex-matched controls on Earth; however, repeated measures within the Inspiration4 crew across mission phases allow for astronauts to serve as their own controls (within-subjects design) by using their pre-flight (that is, baseline) levels as a reference. Future studies, or additional studies with equivalent design, of civilian astronauts in short-duration spaceflight with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the findings or to assign any possible causal links.</p><p id="Par28">Finally, it is worth noting that the Inspiration4 mission was not designed to address how the biological and behavioural responses of the Inspiration4 crew relate to those of professional astronauts or cosmonauts, or those with career-long exposure to spaceflight. Furthermore, the research on the Inspiration4 mission was not designed to determine the safety of spaceflight for all civilians, or to recommend spaceflight for future civilian passengers; the Inspiration4 research projects were also not tasked with making judgements for future crew selection or fitness for spaceflight. The selection of astronauts for spaceflight is exclusive to international space agencies (governmental or commercial). Nonetheless, the Inspiration4 data, along with data from other civilian spaceflight missions, may contribute to the development of reference ranges and pre-flight preparatory tasks (for example, behavioural testing in confined environments) that can help guide future crew selection and mission planning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par29">While broad in its research scope, this study represents only the beginning. Anatomical and physiological variability, small sample size, the operational complexities of a highly constrained mission and limited skill management capabilities combined to preclude confident conclusions on many physiological variables. However, as intended by the TRISH, enhancing exploration platforms and analog definition, and SOMA programmes, these Inspiration4 data will serve as a rich foundation for scaling and enhancing the knowledge base on early phases of space physiology, and expanding our understanding of spaceflight-associated effects on human health. Future missions can also include telemedicine, more autonomous data collection, next-generation sequencing-based in-flight omics assays and related diagnostics tools. Excitingly, some of these same astronauts will be present on future missions and/or contribute to long-term studies of astronaut health, which will help delineate the short- and long-term impacts of spaceflight and continue to prepare future astronauts for their missions.</p><p id="Par30">Finally, it is worth noting that collaboration with government, academia and the private sector at the same time led to lessons learned that should be useful to investigators embarking on similar endeavours in future civilian spaceflight missions. Specifically, co-ordination among diverse research teams can be enabled by agile funding entities (for example, TRISH, SpaceX, philanthropy) and a dedicated project manager. Also, a single institutional review board (IRB) protocol, such as that put in place by TRISH,&#x000a0;can simplify subject consenting, while a standardized database provider (TrialX, funded by TRISH) was critical for data ingestion, cross-institute sharing and standardization for future cross-mission analyses and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches.

The sense organs consist of a mass of calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) that overlie a membrane that is innervated with hair cells. Motion of the crystals relative to the hair cells bends the hair cells, and this bending modifies their firing rates and so provides information on linear acceleration to the central vestibular system.

For these tests, the subject views a red line and a blue line on the touchscreen of a tablet computer, through colour-matched red and blue filters, one over each eye. This provides independent images to each eye. Since the test is performed in darkness, there is no visual information that is seen by both eyes together, and hence there are no visual cues to align the eyes (which would fuse the images on the two retinas). One line remains fixed on the screen, while the other line is positioned by the subject, either vertically or torsionally. The subject&#x02019;s goal is to adjust one line until it appears to be aligned with the other, stationary, line (that is, to null any apparent vertical or rotational offset between the lines). The final amount by which the lines are separated from one another vertically or rotated relative to one another provides a measure of vertical or torsional ocular misalignment, respectively, which produces measures of VAN and TAN. Astronauts completed VAN and TAN measures twice pre-flight and twice post-flight, where each session consisted of 11 VAN and 11 TAN trials.

There are several reasons for this individual testing as opposed to a pooled analysis across subjects. First, the high variability across subjects (typical of many neurovestibular assessments), combined with the small subject pool, makes it unlikely that there would be sufficient statistical power in a pooled analysis. Second, individual testing permits a stepwise approach in which a series of tests can lead to a predictive metric. Finally, SMS is notoriously idiosyncratic, and spaceflight measures are subject to many confounds, which supports a focused longitudinal examination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Cardiovascular function</title><p id="Par46">The Apple Watch Series 6 was used to objectively measure cardiovascular function, which was indexed by blood oxygen saturation levels, heart rate and HRV, as well as activity and energy consumption.

Fourteen of the 18 AMS items were surveyed in the Inspiration4 crew to reduce time burden, and the four items that were removed had significant overlap with other AMS items. Ten AMS items (monotony, boredom, depression, stress, physical exhaustion, sickness, unhappiness, sleepiness, workload and sleep quality) prompted astronauts to rate each item using 11-point Likert scales (range&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x02013;10).
