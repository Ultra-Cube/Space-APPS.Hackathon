<graphic xlink:href="c5sc01058f-ga.jpg" id="ga" position="float" orientation="portrait"/>We have demonstrated that spatial regulation of the same product from two distinct genes generates metabolite diversity.</p></abstract><abstract><p>In secondary metabolite biosynthesis, core synthetic genes such as polyketide synthase genes usually encode proteins that generate various backbone precursors. These precursors are modified by other tailoring enzymes to yield a large variety of different secondary metabolites. The number of core synthesis genes in a given species correlates, therefore, with the number of types of secondary metabolites the organism can produce. In our study, heterologous expression of all the <italic>A. terreus</italic> NRPS-like genes showed that two NRPS-like proteins, encoded by <italic>atmelA</italic> and <italic>apvA</italic>, release the same natural product, aspulvinone E. In hyphae this compound is converted to aspulvinones whereas in conidia it is converted to melanin. The genes are expressed in different tissues and this spatial control is probably regulated by their own specific promoters. Comparative genomics indicates that <italic>atmelA</italic> and <italic>apvA</italic> might share a same ancestral gene and the gene <italic>apvA</italic> is located in a highly conserved region in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species that contains genes coding for life-essential proteins. Our data reveal the first case in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in which the tissue specific production of a single compound directs it into two separate pathways, producing distinct compounds with different functions. Our data also reveal that a single <italic>trans</italic>-prenyltransferase, AbpB, prenylates two substrates, aspulvinones and butyrolactones, revealing that genes outside of contiguous secondary metabolism gene clusters can modify more than one compound thereby expanding metabolite diversity. Our study raises the possibility of incorporation of spatial, cell-type specificity in expression of secondary metabolites of biological interest and provides new insight into designing and reconstituting their biosynthetic pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Filamentous fungi, such as species found within the genus <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, are well known producers of secondary metabolites (SMs) with interesting biological activities. The genome sequencing of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species revealed that the number of putative SM genes greatly exceeds the number of identified SMs, suggesting many novel types of SMs still remain to be discovered.<sup><xref rid="cit1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In general, these SM genes are clustered in the genome.<sup><xref rid="cit2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> A typical cluster contains one key gene required for the synthesis of the precursor skeleton. These genes usually encode large multidomain enzymes belonging to the polyketide synthase (PKS) or non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) class.<sup><xref rid="cit3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Other adjacent genes encode enzymes that are involved in tailoring modifications, transport of the product, or co-regulation of the cluster genes.<sup><xref rid="cit4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In a given fungal species, the SM arsenal is usually governed by the number of key synthetic genes in the genome, and this diversity is multiplied by various tailoring enzymes that give rise to a considerable number of different natural products.<sup><xref rid="cit5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> For instance, the fungus <italic>A. nidulans</italic> has 27 PKS genes, 12 NRPS genes, 14 NRPS-like genes and one PKS/NRPS hybrid gene.<sup><xref rid="cit6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In a previous study, Ahuja <italic>et al.</italic> systematically characterized the polyketide products of eight non reducing PKSs (NR-PKSs) in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>.<sup><xref rid="cit5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In combination with the six previously characterized NR-PKS genes, the study demonstrated that the 14 NR-PKS genes in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> could be divided into seven groups based on phylogenetic analysis. More importantly, each of these NR-PKSs produces a unique product which can be modified by other tailoring enzymes and incorporate into various SM biosynthetic pathways, indicating the potential of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> for biosynthesizing a large variety of different PKS-derived SMs.<sup><xref rid="cit5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>Recently, application of an efficient gene targeting system enabled us to link two NRPS-like genes <italic>apvA</italic> and <italic>btyA</italic> to their corresponding SMs, aspulvinones and butyrolactones, respectively, in <italic>A. terreus</italic> strain NIH 2624.<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In this study, we demonstrated that one NRPS-like gene, <italic>atmelA</italic>, is involved in the synthesis of a brown conidial melanin in this fungus.<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Compared to typical NRPSs, NRPS-like genes encode single module (A-T-TE) proteins missing the condensation (C) domain.<sup><xref rid="cit3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The adenylation (A) domain is responsible for aryl acid substrate recognition and activation. The activated substrate is loaded onto the thiolation (T) domain. The thioesterase (TE) domain is suggested to be involved in the condensation and releasing of the final product.<sup><xref rid="cit8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Therefore, the diversity of NRPS-like products is expanded by a combination of different A domains (substrate selection and activation) and TE domains (various cyclization and release mechanisms). The <italic>A. terreus</italic> genome contains 14 NRPS-like genes with predicted A-T-TE or similar domain architecture and the SM products for the majority of these are unknown.</p><p>Here we report our efforts to systematically characterize the products of these 14 NRPS-like genes. We heterologously expressed each gene in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> under the control of the inducible <italic>alcA</italic> promoter. Surprisingly, our study reveals that two NRPS-like genes, <italic>apvA</italic> and <italic>atmelA</italic>, are responsible for the formation of the same intermediate, aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The aspulvinone E produced by AtmelA is further modified by a tyrosinase, AtmelB, and is incorporated into the brown melanin biosynthesis pathway in <italic>A. terreus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In parallel, the aspulvinone E synthesized by ApvA is further prenylated by a <italic>trans</italic>-prenyltransferase (AbpB) to produce aspulvinones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). AbpB also prenylates butyrolactones, and this reveals that modifying genes outside of specific clusters can be responsible for modifying compounds from more than one SM gene cluster, thus expanding the diversity of SMs produced by an organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>(A) AtmelA and ApvA may synthesize the identical natural product <bold>1</bold> accumulated in different fungal tissues.

The <italic>atmelA</italic> promoter drives expression in conidia, also resulting in the production of aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) but in this cell type it is converted to melanin. Further genetic analysis of <italic>apvA</italic> and <italic>atmelA</italic> indicates that these two genes may share a common ancestral gene. The gene <italic>apvA</italic>, which may result from duplication of the ancestral gene, is inserted in a genomic region consisting of genes that codes for life-essential proteins. Our study suggests an unprecedented pathway for conidial pigment biosynthesis in <italic>A. terreus</italic> that incorporates an NRPS-like product aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) as its substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Our data also demonstrated how the SM diversity can be expanded by (1) allocating the same natural product in different fungal compartments to produce molecules with different functions; (2) encoding tailoring enzyme that is capable of chemically modifying more than one type of SMs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Heterologous expression of the NRPS-like genes <italic>apvA</italic> and <italic>atmelA</italic> in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> both result in aspulvinone E production</title><p>Using a recently reported efficient heterologous expression (HE) system in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>,<sup><xref rid="cit9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> the individual NRPS-like genes identified in the <italic>A. terreus</italic> genome were expressed at either the <italic>wA</italic> or <italic>yA</italic> locus of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> under regulation of the inducible <italic>alcA</italic> promoter (Fig. S1A<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>). In a previous study, targeted deletion of <italic>apvA</italic> depleted production of aspulvinones in <italic>A. terreus</italic> indicating that this NRPS-like gene is responsible for the biosynthesis of the aspulvinone core.<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> As expected, heterologous expression of <italic>apvA</italic> results in accumulation of aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) which is speculated to be the first intermediate in the aspulvinone pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A and B</xref>).<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Unexpectedly, our HE experiments revealed that AtmelA produces the same compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A and B</xref>).

Since we have established the genetic linkage between <italic>apvA</italic> and aspulvinones,<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> we set out to identify the first tailoring enzyme, which we presumed was responsible for prenylating <bold>1</bold> to give <bold>2</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, we could not locate a prenyl transferase (PT) gene proximal to <italic>apvA</italic>.<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> We then targeted each of the putative PT genes in the <italic>A. terreus</italic> genome for deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). The individual genes were knocked out using fragments created by fusion PCR.<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The SM profiles of the correct mutants were examined by LC-MS, and of the 11 different mutants, only the ATEG_01730.1&#x00394; strain accumulated aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Unexpectedly, removal of ATEG_01730.1 leads to the accumulation of butyrolactone II (<bold>5</bold>) as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). A previous study showed that the NRPS-like gene <italic>btyA</italic> is responsible for the biosynthesis of butyrolactone core.<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The expression of three genes, <italic>apvA</italic>, <italic>btyA</italic>, and <italic>abpB</italic> were also analyzed using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). (Fig. S2C<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>) Our data showed that these three genes are co-expressed under aspulvinone and butyrolactone producing conditions. These pieces of evidence suggest that this single PT is responsible for the prenylation of two different metabolites, aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) and butyrolactone II (<bold>5</bold>). Thus, we name the gene <italic>a</italic> (aspulvinone) <italic>b</italic> (butyrolactone) <italic>p</italic> (PT) <italic>B</italic>.</p><fig id="fig4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>HPLC profiles of extracts of <italic>A. terreus</italic> prenyltransferase (PT) genes deletants as detected by UV at 330 nm and 370 nm.

We first deleted the gene <italic>apvA</italic> using the direct repeat (DR) strategy<sup><xref rid="cit10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> followed by the recycling of the <italic>AfpyrG</italic> marker (Fig. S1B<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>). This ensures that aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) identified in the later mutants is not from ApvA. However, limited information is available about the biosynthesis of the brown conidial melanin in <italic>A. terreus</italic>. Our study suggests that the melanin pathway originates from the NRPS-like product aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>), which is unlike the two main precursors [di-hydroxyphenylalanin (DOPA) and dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)] of currently known melanins.<sup><xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The biosynthesis of DOPA melanin starts with a tyrosine that is oxidized to either DOPA or dopaquinone (DAQ) by a tyrosinase.<sup><xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Considering that aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) shares the same phenol moiety as tyrosine, we speculate that a similar tyrosinase might catalyze the hydroxylation of <bold>1</bold> at the <italic>ortho</italic> position to give a dihydroxylated intermediate that becomes incorporated into the brown melanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Following the cluster paradigm, we examined the genes surrounding <italic>atmelA</italic> and identified one gene ATEG_03564.1 (<italic>atmelB</italic>) that encodes a putative tyrosinase. Removal of this gene in the <italic>apvA</italic>&#x00394; background changed the strain's phenotype: the brown melanin was no longer synthesized and the conidia became bright yellow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). As expected, the yellow material is aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>), which accumulated in the metabolite profiles of the <italic>apvA</italic> and <italic>atmelB</italic> double deletion strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). We next deleted the gene <italic>atmelA</italic> in the double <italic>apvA</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>atmelB</italic>&#x00394; strain. The LC-MS profile of this triple deletion mutant shows the abrogation of the aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) which had reappeared in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>), in accord with our HE results that AtmelA was also capable of producing Aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>Aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) produced by ApvA and AtmelA accumulates in different fungal tissues</title><p>Our studies indicate that ApvA and AtmelA synthesize the same product aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>). We next asked how the fungus is able to allocate the same chemical synthesized by different proteins into their own specific pathway without cross-interference. Previous literature reports have shown that the production of SMs and/or their precursors can be specific to both cellular organelle and fungal tissue.<sup><xref rid="cit12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> We speculated that the aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) from the two genes might be generated in different fungal tissues. Since removal of <italic>atmelA</italic> or <italic>atmelB</italic> changes the phenotype of <italic>A. terreus</italic> conidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>), it is likely that aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) from AtmelA might be produced in conidia. Likewise aspulvinones, derived from <bold>1</bold> that is produced by ApvA, might be produced inside the hyphae and secreted into the medium.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we performed tissue-specific extraction<sup><xref rid="cit12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> to reinvestigate the SM profiles of the four strains ((1) wild type; (2) <italic>abpB</italic>&#x00394;; (3) <italic>apvA</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>atmelB</italic>&#x00394;; (4) <italic>apvA</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>atmelB</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>atmelA</italic>&#x00394;). Fungal cultures were divided into three fractions: (1) conidial (mostly conidia and minor conidiophore), (2) top layer agar (mixture of conidiophore, vegetative hyphae, minor invasive hyphae), (3) lower layer agar (mostly invasive hyphae) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C and D</xref>). Compared to the SM profiles of total extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>), extraction of the conidia showed the accumulation of <bold>1</bold> only in the <italic>apvA</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>atmelB</italic>&#x00394; strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>), not in strains carrying <italic>abpB</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>atmelA</italic>&#x00394;. This result indicates that aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) from AtmelA is produced in conidia. Extraction of the hyphal (mostly invasive) fraction showed the production of <bold>1</bold> in the <italic>abpB</italic>&#x00394; strain and compound <bold>2</bold> in wild type, indicating that aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) from ApvA and its derivative <bold>2</bold> are specifically produced in hyphae.</p></sec><sec><title>Exchanging <italic>atmelA</italic> with <italic>apvA</italic>, under control of the <italic>atmelA</italic> promoter, restores melanin production in <italic>A. terreus</italic>
</title><p>Next, we asked about the molecular mechanism for regulating the tissue-specific production of <bold>1</bold>. We first examined the expression profiling of <italic>atmelA</italic> and <italic>apvA</italic> in different tissues using Real-Time qRT-PCR (Fig. S2, see ESI<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref> for experimental details). As expected, the gene <italic>atmelA</italic> is specifically expressed in conidia compartment (Fig. S2B<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>) while the gene <italic>apvA</italic> is locally expressed in hyphae (Fig. S2C<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>). We then probed this question by determining whether ApvA could replace AtmelA in brown melanin biosynthesis. We assumed that tailoring enzymes like AtmelB could still recognize aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) generated from either ApvA or AtmelA. Another study suggests that the products of two tubulin genes, <italic>benA</italic> and <italic>tubC</italic>, are functionally interchangeable.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>, the mutant stain (<italic>apvA</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>atmelA</italic>::<italic>apvA</italic>) produces brownish conidia indicating that the brown conidial pigment is produced in the mutant strain (<italic>apvA</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>atmelA</italic>::<italic>apvA</italic>). As anticipated, the production of aspulvinones (<bold>1</bold> or <bold>2</bold>) were not detected (Fig. S3<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>). The pigment is not produced as much as in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>) probably because <italic>atmelAp</italic>, after all, is not the native promoter of ApvA. Quantitative analysis of their expression using Real-Time qRT-PCR reveals that the expression level of <italic>apvA</italic>, which is under the control of atmelA promoter, is lower than that of <italic>atmelA</italic>. (Fig. S2B<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>) This could be one of the reasons for reduced production of the conidial melanin in the mutant strain (<italic>apvA</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>atmelA</italic>::<italic>apvA</italic>). But more importantly, our experiment shows that compound <bold>1</bold> from <italic>apvA</italic> can be incorporated into the melanin pathway when <italic>apvA</italic> is regulated by <italic>atmelAp</italic>. As mentioned earlier, the production of <bold>1</bold> from <italic>atmelA</italic> is conidia-specific. Thus, this experiment shows that the product of ApvA can also be produced inside conidia and incorporated into melanin, suggesting that the tissue specific allocation of their products may be due to cell-type specific expression of the genes <italic>atmelA</italic> and <italic>apvA</italic> under regulation of their specific promoters.</p><fig id="fig5" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>(A) Phenotype of the <italic>A. terreus</italic> mutant strain <italic>apvA</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>atmelA</italic>::<italic>apvA</italic> (the <italic>A. terreus</italic> wild type is used as positive control that produces melanin, the <italic>atmelA</italic>&#x00394; strain is used as negative control).

We also identified one putative tyrosinase encoded by the gene <italic>atmelB</italic> that is involved in a tailoring modification of aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) to yield the brown conidial pigment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). We speculate that the function of the tyrosinase, AtmelB, might resemble that of its homolog which participates in dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-melanin biosynthesis<sup><xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and catalyzes the <italic>ortho</italic> hydroxylation of the phenol moiety in the aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>).

AtmelA shares 73% sequence similarity with ApvA. We noted that there is a 63 bp sequence in <italic>atmelA</italic>, corresponding to the TE domain of AtmelA, that has strong nucleotide identity with a portion of <italic>apvA</italic>, indicating that these two genes may share a common origin (Fig. S5C<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>). Interestingly, homology analysis of <italic>apvA</italic> and its surrounding genes showed that <italic>apvA</italic> is inserted into a conserved genome region consisting of genes that are essential for fungal survival (Fig. S4<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>). It is possible that the insertion of <italic>apvA</italic> is due to the duplication and translocation of its ancestral homolog. The production of aspulvinone-type SMs by <italic>A. terreus</italic>, in response to general stress, could be related to the chromosomal location of its producing gene <italic>apvA</italic>. However, more experiments are definitely necessary to elucidate the exact role the aspulvinone-type metabolites play in the growth, survival or metabolic processes of the fungus <italic>A. terreus</italic>.</p><p>Previous literature suggested that <italic>p</italic>-hydroxylphenylpyruvate (HPP), which originates from the shikimate pathway, is the biosynthetic precursor of aspulvinones.<sup><xref rid="cit21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="cit22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The shikimate pathway, highly conserved in bacteria, fungi, and plant species, generates carbon skeletons for the aromatic amino acids including tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine.<sup><xref rid="cit23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> HPP is proposed to be an intermediate in the conversion of prephenate to <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine in the shikimate pathway. Limited information has been reported regarding the tissue localization of HPP in fungi. Our study suggests that the distribution of HPP is not limited to certain types of fungal compartments since both the biosynthesis of brown conidial melanin and hyphae specific aspulvinones requires the presence of HPP. Our data indicate that the tissue-specific expression of <italic>apvA</italic> and <italic>atmelA</italic> are due to the promoters of the two genes. The promoter of <italic>apvA</italic> drives expression specifically in hyphae while the promoter of <italic>atmelA</italic> drives expression in conidia. There are many examples of hyphal <italic>versus</italic> spore specific gene regulation. For example, the expression of the melanin synthesis gene <italic>atmelA</italic> might regulated by spore specific transcriptional regulators as demonstrated in a recent study showing that BrlA, the transcription factor required to initiate conidiophore development in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., is necessary for fumiquinazoline gene expression and product production.<sup><xref rid="cit13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The fact that <italic>atmelAp</italic> is capable of turning on the expression of both <italic>apvA</italic> (SM gene) and the <italic>gfp</italic> (reporter gene), suggests that it might be a useful tool for directing the expression of genes specifically inside of conidia.</p><p>Besides spatial regulation of the intermediate, the SM diversity can be further expanded, as shown in our study, through tailoring enzymes that are capable of modifying SMs with different chemical scaffolds. Early literature reported the enzymatic characterization of aspulvinone dimethylallyltransferase in <italic>A. terreus</italic>. This enzyme is capable of catalyzing the mono or dual prenylation of aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>).<sup><xref rid="cit24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The substrate promiscuity of some PTs has also been tested <italic>in vitro</italic> by feeding experiments.<sup><xref rid="cit25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Our study reveals the <italic>in vivo</italic> versatility of AbpB, as it accepts substrates with different chemical scaffolds. Interestingly, the three genes are dispersed in the <italic>A. terreus</italic> genome (<italic>abpB</italic> on chromosome II; <italic>apvA</italic> on chromosome III; <italic>btyA</italic> on chromosome IV), representing another deviation from the SM gene cluster paradigm. We have discovered in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> that in some cases, the corresponding PT genes are not located in the same cluster as the core PKS genes.<sup><xref rid="cit26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="cit27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Further comparison of the butyrolactones with aspulvinones shows that the chemical modifications after prenylation, including epoxidation and dehydrogenation, are very similar (Fig. S6<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>). Thus, these two natural product families may share the same set of tailoring enzymes that specifically modifies the prenyl groups attached by AbpB.</p><p>Fungi are capable of producing a large variety of SMs with unique chemical scaffolds. It is usually expected that core synthetic genes, in a given species, are behind the biosynthesis of different core intermediates, as demonstrated in a study showing that all individual NRPKS in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> generate a unique PKS product.<sup><xref rid="cit5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Phylogenetic analysis, using the protein sequences of those NRPS-like homologs obtained from the Broad Institute <italic>Aspergillus</italic> comparative database, revealed several other characterized NRPS-like homologs including TdiA (terrequinone A biosynthesis in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>),<sup><xref rid="cit8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> RalA (ralfuranone biosynthesis in <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>),<sup><xref rid="cit28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> MicA (microperfuranone biosynthesis in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>),<sup><xref rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> AtqA (asterriquinone biosynthesis in <italic>A. terreus</italic>),<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> BtyA (butyrolactone biosynthesis in <italic>A. terreus</italic>),<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and EchA (echosides biosynthesis in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp.

These NRPS-like enzymes, with A-T-TE domain architecture, fall within Clade I of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S5<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>). They are capable of synthesizing natural products with various chemical scaffolds using similar substrates like phenylpyruvic acid.

Thus, SM diversity is enriched from these disparate starting points. It is also common to identify two highly homologous core synthetic genes, in different species, that produces the same precursor. For example, in the biosynthesis of the meroterpenoids austinol (<italic>A. nidulans</italic>) and terretonin (<italic>A. terreus</italic>), the two PKS genes <italic>ausA</italic> and <italic>trt4</italic> synthesize the same intermediate 3, 5-dimethylorsellinic acid.<sup><xref rid="cit34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>
</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our work indicates that chemical diversity in SM biosynthesis can be expanded <italic>via</italic> multiple dimensions. Prior to our work, the richness of the fungal SM pool was presumed to be determined by the number of SM gene clusters while the clustered genes are associated with the biosynthesis of a distinct type of SM, with some exceptions.<sup><xref rid="cit12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In our study, we have shown that <italic>A. terreus</italic> deploys an additional strategy to enrich its natural product pool. Although the same precursor aspulvinone E (<bold>1</bold>) is shared in two pathways (the aspulvinone pathway, a typical SM pathway and the melanin pathway, producing a self-protection pigment that might also be involved in the pathogenicity of this fungus), the tissue specific expression of their biosynthetic genes results in the production of the same compound in different fungal tissues and allows it to be modified into two different products that, we assume, confer selective advantages in the specific tissues in which they are produced. The localization of production is possibly regulated by their specific promoters, but it is entirely possible that a more complex regulatory mechanism underlies this phenomenon. This expands our insight into spatial regulation of SMs in fungi.<sup><xref rid="cit36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> More investigation into these promoters might provide a means to the cell-type-directed biosynthesis of SMs or manipulating the location of the expression of some genes responsible for products with interesting biological activities. Finally, our data demonstrate that AbpB prenylates compounds in two pathways revealing that two pathways may share the same tailoring genes. It will be of interest to determine if this characteristic is common to, and specific to, prenyl transferases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains and molecular manipulations</title><p>Primers used in this study are listed in Table S1.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref> The fungal strains used in this study are listed in Table S2.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref> The scheme for heterologously expressing the NRPS-like genes of <italic>A. terreus</italic> in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> is shown in Fig. S1.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref> The direct repeat (DR) deletion and <italic>AfpyG</italic> marker recycling experimental design is shown in Fig. S1.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref> The construction of fusion PCR products, protoplast generation, and transformation were carried out as previously described.<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The scheme of diagnostic PCR is shown in Fig. S8.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>
