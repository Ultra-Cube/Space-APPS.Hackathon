Integrated &#x0201c;omics&#x0201d; analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome) of wild type (WT), single and multiple <italic>ADT</italic> KO lines were conducted. Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog (GO) data, with this allowing for enzymatic reaction and metabolome cross-comparisons to uncover dominant or likely metabolic biosynthesis reactions affected. Network analysis of enzymes&#x02013;highly correlated to stem lignin levels&#x02013;deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or processes. These included those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. While prior work helped explain lignin biosynthesis regulation at the transcriptional level, our data here provide support for a new hypothesis that there are additional post-transcriptional and translational level processes that need to be considered. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models <italic>in situ</italic>, with new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering. Additionally, using KEGG defined functional categorization of proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we detected significant changes to glucosinolate, &#x003b1;-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutants. Metabolomics results also revealed that putative carotenoid and galactolipid levels were generally increased in amount, whereas many glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids (including flavonoids and lignans) were decreased in the KO mutants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lignin</kwd><kwd>arogenate dehydratases</kwd><kwd>multi-omics</kwd><kwd>network analysis</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd><kwd>ribocode</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Aeronautics and Space Administration<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000104</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">National Aeronautics and Space Administration<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000104</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="63"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Arogenate is an important branch-point to either tyrosine (Tyr) or phenylalanine (Phe) in vascular plants, whose formation from arogenate (Agn) is catalyzed by arogenate dehydrogenase (ADH) and arogenate dehydratase (ADT), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The Phe so formed can then be incorporated into either proteins or massively utilized in the phenylpropanoid pathway to produce lignins, as well as other related metabolites (e.g., lignans, allyl/propenyl phenols, flavonoids, coumarins, anthocyanins) depending upon the species.

Network analysis (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Szklarczyk et al., 2015</xref>) was also used to (a) identify enzymes or processes most highly correlated to different lignin levels, and (b) reveal potentially novel enzymes or processes related with lignin level regulation and biosynthesis.

Each sample loaded onto the C18 column was washed for 15 min with Solvent A [10 mM ammonium formate, adjusted to pH 10 with ammonium hydroxide (14.8 M)]. The gradient started with a linear increase of 0% Solvent B [10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10, acetonitrile:water (90:10 v/v)] to: 5% Solvent B over 10 min, 45% Solvent B over 65 min, and then to 100% Solvent B over 15 min.

Data acquisition lagged the gradient start and end times by 15 min to account for column dead volume that allowed for the tightest overlap possible in a two-column operation.

Individual peptide intensity values were determined by dividing the base peak intensity by the relative ratio associated with each reporter ion. Each iTRAQ experiment references a pool of peptides so that all experiments could be linked. All peptide data were combined into a single data table and were transformed to a log<sub>2</sub> value, following which each data row of each iTRAQ experiment was shifted so that the reference pool value in each iTRAQ experiment was equal. Then each column of data representing each channel of each iTRAQ experiment was mean centered. All peptide values were next transformed to undo the log<sub>2</sub>, by calculating 2 to the power of each data point. Peptide abundance values were then separated into two datasets, one of peptides unique to a single protein and peptides which are shared between two or more proteins. Peptides were rolled up to a protein value by summing the peptides that belong to each protein in each dataset. Where the same protein was calculated in both datasets, only one protein value was selected in a final protein rollup table with the protein value from the unique peptide rollup given preference if identified in all channels. Individual protein roll-up calculations from the unique or shared peptide table were designated in the final protein roll-up table. KEGG Orthology protein family groups (KEGOs) were also determined for both protein and transcript data. Protein KEGOs were calculated by summing all unique peptide values found within a KEGO. Transcript KEGOs were calculated by summing all transcript count data within a like KEGO. All protein, transcript and KEGO values were converted to a log<sub>2</sub> value. Log<sub>2</sub> values below 2 in all protein datasets were removed as these primarily represent noise signals which interfere with <italic>z</italic>-score calculations. All replicates were averaged, and MA plots were constructed for each comparison between the average value of each WT and mutant line. All fold change pairs analyzed in MA plots, were combined into a single dataset and the values obtained in the A axis were ranked from lowest to highest. A sliding window which represented 10% of the total number of data point was used to calculate the <italic>z</italic>-score value along the A axis for each data point (in the MA plot). <italic>Z</italic>-score (<italic>z</italic> = x-&#x003bc;/&#x003c3; = (datapoint&#x02013;median)/standard deviation).

Known interactions from either curated databases or which were experimentally determined were considered, along with predicted interactions from gene fusion, gene co-occurrence, gene neighborhood experiments, as well as from text mining, co-expression datasets and protein homology datasets. Node interactions were selected only if STRING returned a minimum interaction score of 0.4 or higher and for nodes with at least one interaction.

The general rationale for this approach relied on the assumption that variance is similar for biomolecules of similar abundances. Transcript or peptide measurements with similar abundances can therefore act as pseudo-replicates producing similar distribution parameters. This strategy is commonly utilized for expression data and with various bioinformatics tools [e.g., SAM (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tusher et al., 2001</xref>), limma (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>), and VAMPIRE (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hsiao et al., 2005</xref>)].</p><p>We applied this approach to log<sub>2</sub> fold change transcriptome, proteome and metabolome data between each <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutant and WT analysis.

Resulting <italic>z</italic>-score calculations then allowed for normalization of data into units of standard deviation (away from an average or zero-fold change value).

The largest primary metabolite classes identified were related to carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids. Fold-changes found in the carbohydrate class included on average decreases in ascorbate (2.6 in leaf, 2.3 in stem) and dehydroascorbate (2.6 in leaf, 1.5 in stem). While not detected in leaf tissue, melibiose (3.2 fold), and xylitol (2.3 fold) were lower in abundance in the stems.</p><p>In both leaf and stem tissues, the most significant change of all metabolites identified from GC-MS data was that of an increase in sorbitol (5.9 fold in leaf, 152 fold in stem). Knocking out even a single <italic>ADT</italic> isoform in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has profound effects on sorbitol biosynthesis, and perhaps on a plant-wide level. <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al.

By producing so much sorbitol <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutants may too be experiencing changes in chlorophyll, protein and RNA levels. Moreover, these plant lines may also be under increased levels of stress relative to WT plants. Glycolic acid (2.1 fold in leaf and 2.3 fold in stem) additionally was found to be increased in <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutants <italic>versus</italic> WT. Glycolic acid is produced when ribulose bisphosphate (RuBisCo) fixes O<sub>2</sub> instead of CO<sub>2</sub>.

Nine glucosinolates, which are nitrogen- and sulfur-containing metabolites synthesized by plants as defense against herbivory and pathogens, were also identified. Glucosinolates derived from homomethione (i.e., glucoiberin, glucohirsutin, 7-methylsulfinylheptylglucosinolate, and glucohesperalin) generally decreased in abundance in the <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutants compared to WT, whereas those derived from Trp or Phe showed mixed abundance changes depending on the <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutant and tissue type. Glucobrassicin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin and 1-methoxyglucobrassicin, all derived from Trp, showed increases and decreases depending on the specific <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutant analyzed. 4-Methoxyglucobrassicin (Trp derived) increased in abundance in most <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutants leaf samples, and in most of the double/triple/quadruple <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutants as well as in <italic>adt5</italic>. Ties between glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids, with lignin being synthesized in the phenylpropanoid pathway, have been previously documented in the literature, suggesting that there is a strong link between these two pathways.

Carotenoids and their cleavage apocarotenoid products, which may also serve as signaling molecules, are important in assembly of photosynthesis and antenna proteins for photosynthesis and photoprotection (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Cazzonelli and Pogson, 2010</xref>). Protein analysis of photosynthesis and antenna protein biosynthesis pathways showed a relatively high proportion of significantly changed proteins (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>) in <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutants suggesting that knocking out <italic>ADTs</italic> in plants also affects photosynthesis.</p><p>While increases in the proportion of significantly changed proteins were observed in photosynthesis and carbon fixation pathways, especially in stems, such large changes were not seen at the corresponding transcript level. The fact that mRNA pools related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation were not changed much, whereas translation copy numbers were largely increased, raises the possibility of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Other categories which were markedly different between protein and transcript data included those involved in Phe metabolism, and glycolate/decarboxylate metabolism. These were found to be highly changed in the protein data, especially in stem tissues, but less so at the transcript level. Categories that showed relatively high changes at the transcript level, but did not seem to translate to higher changes at the protein level, included those pathways involved in alanine/aspartate/glutamate, propanoate, and galactose metabolism, respectively. This was not surprising given that ADTs biosynthesize Phe.</p><p>We also observed that shikimate-chorismate derived metabolism pathways (i.e., to Phe, Tyr, and tryptophan) were highly changed at both transcript and protein levels. It is known that Phe, Tyr, and Trp produced via the shikimate-chorismate pathway contribute to feedback inhibition mechanisms of various shikimate pathway enzymes upstream of ADT (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Tzin and Galili, 2010</xref>), and that <italic>ADT</italic> KOs can alter not only Phe levels but also levels of Tyr and Trp (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Corea et al., 2012a</xref>). We thus hypothesize that in <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutants there likely may be alterations in the levels of other metabolites synthesized from Phe/Tyr/Trp precursors. These could potentially affect metabolites including phytohormones, which could, in turn, produce system-wide effects. For instance, phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is synthesized from Trp, and IAA can affect changes in growth, development and metabolism (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Zhao, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Another phytohormone potentially altered in <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutants may be jasmonic acid (JA). While we did not specifically detect JA or any other phytohormone in the untargeted metabolomics data, changes in JA precursors may be indicative of potential changes in the downstream phytohormone levels. JA is derived from &#x003b1;-linolenic acid (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Weber, 2002</xref>) and &#x003b1;-linolenic acid metabolism pathways were highly changed at both the transcript and protein level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). &#x003b1;-Linolenic acid is not only a precursor to JA, but also aids in photosynthetic thylakoid membrane fluidity (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Yashroy, 1987</xref>) potentially acting as another contributor to alterations affecting photosynthesis. Other studies indicated that JA levels have a strong relationship to lignin levels. <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Denness et al. (2011)</xref> showed that both JA-isoleucine production and ROS production could form a negative feedback loop which can then repress each other&#x02019;s production and influence lignin accumulation. Given there were lower levels of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate levels in the metabolomes derived from both leaf and stem tissue of <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutants compared with WT, it may be that ROS is higher in concentration in <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutants given that there is less ascorbate to scavenge ROS. This along with altered levels of JA could potentially be contributing signals affecting lignin biosynthesis. Ascorbate is also a cofactor for biosynthesis of several other phytohormones, such as ethylene, gibberellins, and abscisic acid (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Pastori et al., 2003</xref>). Due to the potential for all these various phytohormones to be altered in amounts when <italic>ADT</italic> is knocked out, we hypothesize this may be why we see multiple pathway enzymes and metabolite levels affected and not just those directly upstream or downstream of <italic>ADT</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S3.SS4"><title>Integrated Metabolome, Proteome, and Transcriptome Analysis</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> shows Pearson&#x02019;s Pairwise log<sub>2</sub> abundance dataset correlations between each WT and <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutant, as compared to every other <italic>ADT</italic> KO mutant between both proteins and transcripts at the gene product (protein or transcript) and KEGG ortholog (KEGO) enzyme family levels.

Indeed, comparisons between proteomic and transcriptomic data can highlight which proteins and transcripts have a co-regulatory response (i.e., a high transcript level with a high protein level).

DRH1 is a ATP/dATP-dependent RNA helicase and polynucleotide-dependent ATPase (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Okanami et al., 1998</xref>). Export of poly(A)(+) RNA has been shown to be greatly blocked in DRH1 mutants (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2016</xref>).

From this body of knowledge, we know that lignin biosynthesis is influenced by a series of transcription factors, such as NAC master switches, which can activate or repress an array of other downstream transcription factors (e.g., MYBs). What is lesser known are what additional post-transcriptional controls of lignin or other phenylpropanoids exist. Due to our discovery that modulating ADTs produces differential lignin contents in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the opportunity was presented where&#x02013;through this multi-omics study&#x02013;we could investigate molecular profiles with step-wise decreases or increases in lockstep to varying lignin levels. These results of our investigation suggest that there are potentially multiple processes, phytohormones and layers of regulation involved in lignin biosynthesis or in response to decreased carbon flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway.</p><p>Since this study was focused on correlations specific to lignin deposition, most attention was paid to correlative levels found in stems, although other phenylpropanoid-derived biomolecules and other pathways were also affected by <italic>ADT</italic> composition changes in leaves. It may be an interesting and informative exercise to further explore correlative enzyme abundances to other phenylpropanoids that may play a more central role in leaf tissue function. For example, those associated with UV protection (e.g., flavonoids and sinapate esters) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Stapleton and Walbot, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Landry et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mazza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cl&#x000e9; et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan et al., 2014</xref>), in order to tease out specific post-transcriptional biosynthesis regulation of formation of these other phenylpropanoids.</p><p>Ultimately, the multi-omics investigation and network analysis presented here proved invaluable for understanding systems level changes that modulated ADTs evoke in a model vascular plant. Importantly, it highlighted potentially new levels of post-transcriptional regulation of lignin/phenylpropanoids that can provisionally serve as biomolecular targets for follow-on analyses and/or for bioengineering purposes, i.e., aimed at modulating or modeling lignin/phenylpropanoids in vascular plants. These proteins can thus be used in follow-on lignin-associated enzyme validation studies and/or can potentially serve as truly novel bioengineering targets for manipulation of lignin/phenylpropanoid levels in vascular plants.</p></sec><sec id="S4.SS3"><title>Potential of a Lignin Regulating &#x0201c;Ribocode&#x0201d;</title><p>Ribosomes are the effectors in the final steps of gene expression, and it has emerged recently that ribosomes themselves could contribute to regulation via differential ribosomal subunit abundance. Evidence recently has also shown that according to developmental, environmental and pathological conditions, cells can produce different populations of ribosomes which differ in their ribosomal protein and RNA composition. These &#x0201c;specialized ribosomes&#x0201d; suggest that the unique ribosomal composition determines the translational activity of the ribosome and thus controls the biosynthesis of specific proteins and enzymes. For many years, ribosomes were thought to consist of a set number of ribosomal proteins (RPs) and rRNAs, with each RP present as a single copy with resulting conserved stoichiometry and homogeneity. One of the first indications that different types of ribosomes existed was from the study of RP paralogs in plants. In work done by <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Sussex (1995)</xref>, it was found that RPL16 paralog gene expression patterns in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were mutually exclusively expressed in different organs of the plant. In yeast studies, deletion of specific RP paralogs also gave rise to unique phenotypes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Ni and Snyder, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Enyenihi and Saunders, 2003</xref>). In human studies, evidence came from patients displaying genetic diseases (i.e., ribosomopathies) caused by haploinsufficiency of genes encoding key factors in ribosome biogenesis or RPs (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Draptchinskaia et al., 1999</xref>). Proteomic-driven analyses exploring composition of purified ribosomes under various conditions identified all RPs differentially expressed between conditions in murine embryonic stem cells, suggesting that different translational statuses were associated with differential stoichiometry among RPs (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Slavov et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we used the STRING (see text footnote 7) algorithm to identify connections/associations between lignin profile correlated proteins. Our results returned interactions between nucleus and plastid proteins (e.g., RPL2.1 and DRH1). While there is currently no direct evidence in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that this association exists, there is growing documentation of interactions between homologs of these proteins in other organisms (e.g., humans, yeast, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Gomez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Havugimana et al., 2012</xref>). Additional studies, however, would need to be performed to verify the actual association, if any, between eukaryotic and plastid translation-associated proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>These studies indicating the influence of differential ribosomal subunit stoichiometry on differential phenotypes and/or translational products suggest that the ribosome has the ability to function in a regulatory fashion in translation. These supporting data, along with observations of correlative associations between specific ribosomes and lignin production in this study here, support the hypothesis that lignin levels in vascular plants may be partially controlled by specialized ribosome compositions or a lignin &#x0201c;ribocode.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
