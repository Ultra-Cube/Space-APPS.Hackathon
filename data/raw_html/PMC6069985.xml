This eukaryotic organism provides the opportunity to study genetic mechanisms in the whole animal rather than a cell culture. In addition, it can consume a bacterial or an axenic food source thereby enabling the identification of diet-related biological processes. Placing the worms from bacteria seeded agar plates (OP50 NGM) to liquid axenic media poses a drastic change for the animals. For example, the animals display locomotive differences in the liquid by swimming via a rapid C-shape thrashing motion as opposed to crawling via a sinusoidal configuration on solid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Behavior and physiological differences arise when the worms are grown in liquid axenic media (such as CeMM; <italic>C. elegans</italic> Maintenance Medium or CeHR; <italic>C. elegans</italic> Habitation and Reproduction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In axenic media, the worms exhibit phenotypical alterations such as delayed development, reduced fecundity, increased longevity, and altered body morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Environment changes can trigger different gene expression profiles, and these profiles can be transmitted to the subsequent generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Changing the environment of the animals from agar to axenic media, therefore, can cause transcriptome-level alterations which may have a sustained effect on the progenies. However, the knowledge about transcriptomic responses to axenic media is limited. For example, in their microarray analysis, Szewczyk et al. could manage to obtain reliable data for only 1202 cDNAs on all three arrays consistently for CeMM-grown worms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The common usage of axenic media in space, toxicology, and pharmacology studies highlights the necessity of a complete transcriptomic analysis, preferably with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">In its natural habitat, <italic>C. elegans</italic> occupies microbiota-rich decaying plant material and experiences a continuous environment shift between liquid and solid conditions along with the variations in its diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The wild-type laboratory strain of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (N2) has been cultured in both liquid and solid conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but bacteria-seeded agar plates are used more commonly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has been reported that the domestication of the N2 strain has created a selective pressure on the animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Some of the critical questions that await answers are whether: 1.) the adaptive responses depend on the genotype or the environment change; 2.) the environment change-induced gene expression profiles are transmitted to the successive generation in equal levels for different genotypes; 3.) the environment change-induced gene expression profiles are transmitted to the next generation equally for different environmental conditions.</p><p id="Par18">To study the maternal effects on transcriptomic responses of <italic>C. elegans</italic> from solid to liquid environments, we maintained the P<sub>0</sub> worms on bacteria-seeded agar plates and F<sub>1</sub> in liquid cultures. By culturing F<sub>2</sub> generation back on agar, we identified the maintained maternal transcriptional responses. The N2 strain and a wild isolate AB1 strain were used to examine if a different genotype attributes to the transcriptional dynamics. It is important to note that even though the N2 and the AB1 strains are relatively close to each other in the phylogenetic tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], AB1 is not the ancestral strain of N2. Therefore, the observed differences in norm of reaction can stem from the natural genetic differences between N2 and AB1 as much as the impact of laboratory domestication on adaptive responses. We found substantial variances in gene expression profiles resulting from different genotypes, environments, and genotype-environment interactions. Our results from RNA-seq data analysis and microscopy showed consistency for the predicted and observed phenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a large number of genes are expressed only in specific growth conditions, and many of these genes previously lacked experimental expressed sequence tag (EST) or cDNA evidence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par19">To induce an adaptive response and observe its sustained effects on the following generation, the P<sub>0</sub> generation <italic>C. elegans</italic> was grown on agar, the F<sub>1</sub> generation in liquid, and the F<sub>2</sub> generation back on agar (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1a). We carried out three sets of experiments with different food sources and animal strains. For the first experiment, the F<sub>1</sub> generation N2 strain was grown in axenic CeHR Medium. To examine the effect of dietary changes in the liquid cultures, we cultured the F<sub>1</sub> generation N2 strain in bacterial S-Medium for the second experiment. Finally, the transcriptomic response differences were investigated by growing F<sub>1</sub> generation AB1 strain in CeHR Medium. For each generation, RNA-seq was performed on young adult animals with three replicates to determine the transcriptional responses (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Distinct gene groups are expressed exclusively in specific environmental conditions</title><p id="Par20">The transcriptome-based clustering of the experiments in the dendrogram of Jensen-Shannon distances demonstrated that the genotypes are separated from each other (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Exposure to different environmental conditions causes the N2 transcriptome to be separated even further than the AB1 transcriptome as illustrated by the dendrogram and principal component analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1b). These results suggest that the genotype plays a key role in adaptive response, and the different strains of the animals can show highly distinct transcriptome profiles under environmental changes. We categorized the genes by using Venn diagrams to identify if their expressions are condition specific (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). We considered the genes expressed if their Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) values are greater than one as this is a commonly used criterion for expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The majority of the expressed genes are conserved among the P<sub>0</sub>, F<sub>1</sub>, and F<sub>2</sub> generations. Nevertheless, hundreds of genes are expressed only under particular conditions. The number of the uniquely expressed genes showed a significant difference between CeHR grown AB1 and N2 strains, but not within the N2 strain experiments (Chi-squared test with Yates correction; <italic>P-value</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01 and <italic>P-value</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9, respectively). In addition, the N2 strain showed an overall decrease in the transcription levels when exposed to the changes in growth conditions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). AB1 strain, however, demonstrated an increase in the total FPKM but a decrease in the average FPKM under CeHR (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). Interestingly, the number of gene expression patterns transmitted to the next generation after exposure to an environment change (F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) varies among the experiments (Chi-squared test with Yates correction; <italic>P-value</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Together, these results seem to suggest that the transmission of the gene expression is not exclusively dependent on the genotype and the environment separately&#x02014;but dependent on their interaction, whereas the condition-specific expression of genes is affected by the genotype.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Different strains and environmental conditions present variations in transcriptional responses. <bold>a</bold> Dendrogram created based on the gene expression (FPKM) values for the strains and the environmental conditions. <bold>b</bold> Principal component analysis plot of gene expression data. <bold>c</bold> Categorization of the expressed genes in the three experiments.

To note, only the polyadenylated ncRNA molecules were included in the analysis, and piRNA and miRNA molecules were excluded from the analysis due to their short lengths. The ncRNA molecules were predominantly observed in the P<sub>0</sub> generation of N2 strain compared to the P<sub>0</sub> AB1 strain. Moreover, fewer ncRNA molecules were expressed when the animals are exposed to an environment change (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref><italic>,</italic> d, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). Our results indicate that ncRNA expression is mainly silenced when the worms are exposed to the tested environmental changes. The fact that a laboratory condition presents an environment change for the wild-isolate may explain why P<sub>0</sub> animals of AB1 showed less ncRNA expression compared to the N2 strain. One particular exception to this pattern is the ncRNA molecules that are commonly expressed in all three generations. We identified that the majority of these ncRNAs (59&#x02013;66%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;322) are conserved among the three experiments (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Dataset S1). This conservation implies that this group of ncRNAs plays important regulatory functions in the cell and their expression is required regardless of the environmental changes. Overrepresented phenotype for these ncRNAs is dendrite development variant (FDR adj. <italic>p-value</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, six-fold enrichment) suggesting a potential role for them in generation of neuronal extensions.</p><p id="Par22">We reasoned that if a particular group of genes is only expressed under specific conditions, we might detect transcript evidence to computationally predicted but experimentally unconfirmed genes, especially considering that CeHR is not a common medium used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> research. Notably, we were able to identify transcript evidence to 21% of the list of unconfirmed genes from WormBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] by simply growing the animals in different environmental conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Unexpectedly, a substantial amount of the transcript evidence was found with animals raised in commonly used OP50 NGM. We compared our list of expressed unconfirmed genes in OP50 NGM-grown N2 to those from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and found that 54% of the unconfirmed genes from our list (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;292) have also shown expression in the study by Dallaire et al. but were not reported as transcript evidence in WormBase. The remaining 46% of the genes must have been induced due to the subtle differences introduced in laboratory environment (e.g., light and environment). Similar to the confirmed genes, gene expression transmission to the successive generation after environmental change demonstrated a difference between and within the strains (Chi-squared test with Yates correction; <italic>P-value</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, <italic>P-value&#x02009;=</italic>&#x000a0;0.02, respectively). Given that it can robustly provide transcript evidence to unconfirmed genes, our approach and data can be a rich resource for discovery of novel genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Environment, genotype, and environment-genotype specific expression of genes</title><p id="Par23">We grouped the genes based on their genotype, environment, or genotype-environment interaction specific expressions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Dataset S2). For this analysis, a more stringent criterion was used to eliminate any potential noise from the data. That is, we only considered the genes with expression levels higher than <italic>pmp-3</italic> of FPKM&#x02009;=&#x02009;21, and excluded genes with FPKM &#x0003c;&#x02009;21 from the analysis. This housekeeping gene was selected as a reference because of its stable expression levels found both in our analysis and previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Specifically for the ncRNA molecules, we reasoned that expression levels higher than that of a housekeeping gene should provide strong evidence for expression.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Shown are the number of gene expressions exclusive to environment, genotype, or genotype-environment interactions.

Given that this pathway functions in numerous behavioral activities such as reproduction, locomotion, mechanosensation and chemosensation, it is likely that the neuropeptide signaling pathway plays a crucial role in rapid adaptation to CeHR and is evolutionarily conserved between the strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The &#x0201c;genotype-specific&#x0201d; expression represents the genes found in only one of the strains under a single environmental condition. All the N2 specific genes showed GO enrichment for body morphogenesis in all the three generations while GO enrichment for reproduction and locomotion were observed in P<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>1</sub> generations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Previously, we reported that the N2 worms produce less progeny compared to the AB1 animals in CeHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Our analysis showed that along with the reproduction genes, genes related to hermaphrodite genitalia development were expressed exclusively in the N2 strain in CeHR. This finding may suggest vulva aberrations in the reproductive system. In addition, the exclusive expression of the genes functioning in positive regulation of multicellular organism growth may help the animals readapt to the OP50 NGM condition in the F<sub>2</sub> generation of the N2 animals.</p><p id="Par26">The genes expressed solely under a particular environment and strain were categorized as &#x0201c;genotype-environment interaction&#x0201d; genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This group of genes did not demonstrate an enrichment of GO terms. The proportion of ncRNA molecules in our group of genes showed correlation with our hypothesis that the majority of the ncRNAs are silenced under the tested environmental changes. For example, the N2 worms showed relatively higher proportions of ncRNAs for interaction and genotype-related genes on OP50 NGM, but these proportions were much lower in more stressful CeHR and CeHR reversion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>N2 strain presents higher differential expression under environment changes</title><p id="Par27">To investigate the differences in transcriptional responses between the strains and among the environmental conditions, we identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We considered genes as differentially expressed if their FPKM is greater than one and their expression is altered over two-folds among the conditions with FDR-adjusted <italic>p-values</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05. The estimated fold change responses of 20 randomly selected transcripts (ten for OP50 NGM against CeHR and ten for CeHR against CeHR reversion) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4a, b and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2 and S3). We found the highest number of DEGs between OP50 NGM and CeHR conditions for the N2 strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This indicates that the change in diet and physical environment triggers more transcriptional responses for adaptation of the N2 strain. The number of DEGs were much lower for the F<sub>2</sub> generation of the same experiment, suggesting that the majority of the gene expressions started to resemble the P<sub>0</sub> animals. This finding was expected as most of the gene expression patterns return to the steady-state levels after a short period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The change in only the physical condition introduced by the S-Medium apparently did not cause as drastic transcriptional responses as the CeHR since the number of the DEGs were lower (38 and 45% lower number of upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively). However, S-Medium reversion conditions demonstrated higher DEGs compared to OP50 NGM. We note that we are able to maintain the worms in S-Medium for only one generation, potentially because of the toxins released by the bacteria in the liquid environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, additional genetic mechanisms may be required for re-adaptation of the animals from S-Medium. Transcriptional variations were more modest across the generations for AB1 animals than the N2 strain.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>The differential expression of the genes (FPKM &#x0003e;&#x02009;1, FDR adj. <italic>P-</italic>value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, and log2(fold change of the FPKM values)&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2) between the environment conditions and the strains.

We wished to compare our results to those from CeMM-grown worms as CeMM has a very similar base medium to CeHR. For the 21 upregulated and 26 downregulated genes reported in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we could only identify one common downregulated gene in N2 and AB1 and four and seven common upregulated genes in N2 and AB1, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). It is unclear why the DEGs among the axenic media studies mostly disagree, but some potential reasons can be the difference in the technology used and the modifications made in the media. For instance, microarray technology has been reported to introduce more background noise and cross-hybridization and detect a lesser number of DEGs compared to RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A more unified study conducted with RNA-seq may help resolve the discrepancy issues among the axenic media experiments.</p><p id="Par29">In our previous study, we have shown that CeHR-grown N2 and AB1 <italic>C. elegans</italic> display different phenotypical traits on their body morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. That is, adult animals of both strains demonstrated physical differences in CeHR compared to the OP50 NGM-grown ones, but the CeHR-grown AB1 strain was even longer and thinner than the CeHR-grown N2 strain in average (N2 length is 825.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;74.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m and width is 45.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, and AB1 length is 876.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;67.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m and width is 38.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m). In accordance with this finding, the GO enrichment analysis results demonstrated enrichment for body morphogenesis for upregulated genes in CeHR compared to OP50 NGM in the N2 strain, but not the AB1 strain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Moreover, genes upregulated under the CeHR condition in the AB1 strain compared to the N2 strain were overrepresented for body morphogenesis. The fact that this GO term is not enriched for AB1 may imply that the phenotype is caused by a separate transcriptional mechanism. To test this, we acquired the genes associated with &#x0201c;long&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;thin&#x0201d; phenotypes from WormBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and compared these genes to the DEGs in our list. These phenotypes are generally found by RNAi knockdown of genes. We found that six and nineteen differentially expressed genes functioning in long or thin phenotypes in N2 and AB1, respectively, but only one gene, <italic>his-67</italic>, was common between the strains (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5). Thus, it is possible that the different gene expression profiles contribute to the body morphology variations between the strains.</p><p id="Par30">Neuropeptide signaling pathway genes were enriched in response to environmental changes. The pathway genes were upregulated in the liquid environments compared to agar in N2 and AB1.

We performed pathway enrichment analysis on DEGs to determine whether dietary sensor pathways, such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and target of rapamycin (TOR), are affected in the tested liquid cultivations. We have not observed enrichment for the renowned dietary sensor pathways but found other metabolic pathways to be affected. For instance, in CeHR, metabolic process in N2 and lysosome and fatty acid metabolism in AB1 demonstrated overrepresentation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). CeMM-grown animals have been reported not to show pathologies related to starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

The transmission of the environment-induced differential gene expressions to the F<sub>2</sub> generation from F<sub>1</sub> was between 20 and 34% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). To assess whether the transmitted differential gene expressions are orchestrated by the same transcriptional regulators (i.e., transcription factors), we first evaluated the promoter regions of these genes for motif enrichments as potential recognition sites. The S-Medium experiment did not present any motif enrichment while the CeHR did for multiple sequence motifs in both the strains. The enriched motifs from both the upregulated and downregulated genes demonstrated differences between the strains, indicating that distinct transcriptional regulators can potentially be in play. We further compared the motifs from the upregulated genes against known transcription factor recognition sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] to find if common transcription factors induce gene expressions in CeHR for the strains. One such motif from both the strains is a recognition site for transcription factor MDL-1 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5a). This transcription factor has regulatory functions in the inhibition of germline growth and longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Other motifs from upregulated genes did not exhibit enrichment for transcription factor recognition. To test the human biological processes related to the putative MDL-1 recognition motifs from both the strains, we performed GO analysis for the DNA motifs against human promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Both the motifs were overrepresented with the sensory perception of smell GO term, presumably corresponding to chemosensation functioning in the detection of environmental changes in worms. However, other enriched terms were different for these two motifs. For instance, the motif from the N2 strain had an overrepresentation of DNA damage checkpoint and transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter while the motif from the AB1 strain was enriched for G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway and positive regulation of immune response (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5a).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Different strains and the environment conditions contribute to differences in the maternal gene expression profiles. <bold>a</bold> The DEGs in the F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, and both (F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) generations were identified in comparison to the gene expressions in the P<sub>0</sub> animals.

The comparison of our list of DEGs to the putative transcription factor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] revealed that the majority of the differentially expressed transcription factors genes are strain and condition-specific (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5b). None of the CeHR reversion-induced transcription factor genes were common between the strains indicating different transcriptional re-adaptive responses to agar plates for the N2 and AB1 strains.

We discarded any enrichments on embryonic cells as we conducted all our experiments on the L4 stage worms. The downregulated genes in CeHR demonstrated enrichment for reproductive system-related tissues such as the oocyte, Z2, and Z3 for both the strains. This possibly reflects the changes in the reproduction of the worms in CeHR. However, upregulated genes in CeHR exhibited overrepresentation on different tissues between the strains: DEGs in N2 were mainly enriched for cylindrical hypodermal syncytium in head; DEGs in AB1 were enriched for neuronal tissues. The genes upregulated in response to S-Medium showed overrepresentation for neuronal tissues, but to different ones than the CeHR-exposed AB1 strain genes. Notably, downregulated genes in CeHR for both the strains and in S-Medium for N2 are enriched in cephalic sheath cell (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest that laboratory and wild-isolate strain worms show significant variations in the transcriptomic responses to the environmental alteration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Functional profiles of the differentially expressed genes show correlation with the observed phenotype</title><p id="Par35">We wondered if the functional data analysis results indeed point to phenotypical alterations in the animals. To test this, we employed microscopy techniques to detect the potential phenotypes. In the N2 strain, the genes functioning in reproduction and oogenesis have been downregulated in CeHR compared to agar and reversion. In AB1, the DEGs among the conditions did not show the same GO enrichment. This pattern is an indicator of phenotypical changes in the reproductive system that can be observed in CeHR but absent in reversion for N2. To test our prediction, we examined the germlines of N2 and AB1 adults in the different growth conditions via confocal microscopy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S8). CeHR grown N2 but not AB1 adults displayed aberrant germlines. Additionally, fewer oocytes were observed in CeHR-grown N2 strain compared to OP50 NGM-grown N2 strain. These findings suggest that the reduced fecundity in CeHR raised N2 animals may have resulted from the inability of animals to make gametes. In agreement with our hypothesis, the worms placed back to agar plates did not exhibit the similar phenotypical abnormalities with CeHR grown animals (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>N2 but not AB1 <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibit germline abnormalities in CeHR. <bold>a</bold> N2 and AB1 germlines exhibit normal germ cell morphologies and numbers in OP50 NGM (aberrant germlines were observed in 21 and 12.5% of the worms, respectively). Germlines of S-Medium grown animals are similar to OP50 NGM grown animals. However, embryos accumulate in 36% of the S-Medium grown adults. As expected, N2 adults grown in CeHR exhibit aberrant germlines with drastically reduced germ cell numbers, which results in an overall smaller germline (86% of the worms). N2 adults in CeHR have a significantly fewer number of oocytes and a high number of internally hatched larvae. These abnormalities are not observed in CeHR-grown AB1 adults (aberrant germlines were observed in 33% of the worms). <bold>b</bold> Dissected out gonadal arms of N2 <italic>C. elegans</italic> grown on OP50 NGM and CeHR.

We utilized a transgenic line of <italic>C. elegans</italic> that expresses functional CED-1::GFP fusion protein in sheath cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. CED-1 functions by initiating a signaling pathway in phagocytic cells that promotes cell corpse engulfment and is commonly used as a marker to detect cells undergoing the apoptotic pathway.

Hence, we reasoned that the cuticles might show morphological differences between agar and CeHR-grown N2 animals. In adult animals, cuticular structures were difficult to distinguish between N2 and AB1 via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). More pronounced cuticular structures were detected in the earlier larval stages (L3) with SEM. We observed more protruding alae structures in CeHR-grown N2 larvae compared to AB1 larvae, but the annuli were indistinguishable between the two strains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Comparing 42 genes annotated with alae morphology variant from WormBase to our data, we identified 15 of these genes (<italic>dpy-2</italic>, <italic>dpy-3</italic>, <italic>dpy-5</italic>, <italic>dpy-7</italic>, <italic>dpy-8</italic>, <italic>dpy-9</italic>, <italic>dpy-10</italic>, <italic>dpy-18</italic>, <italic>lon-3</italic>, <italic>qua-1</italic>, <italic>rol-6</italic>, <italic>sqt-1</italic>, <italic>sqt-2</italic>, <italic>sqt-3</italic>, and <italic>mlt-10</italic>) upregulated under CeHR conditions in N2 but not in AB1 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S7 and S8).

Different strains of the worms present unique transcriptional characteristics in the adaptive responses, and these characteristics show correlation with the observed phenotypes. For instance, we detected differential expression in the body morphology-related genes along with the phenotypical changes on the body morphology in CeHR-grown N2 strain, but not the AB1 strain. Furthermore, we found that different environments provoke the condition-specific expression of genes, and some of these genes lacked previous experimental EST or cDNA evidence.</p><p id="Par40">Our results revealed that specific groups of genes are expressed only in particular environments. Some of these genes lacked transcript evidence previously (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Considerable effort has been devoted to annotating the genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but the standard WormBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] annotation still contains thousands of &#x0201c;predicted genes&#x0201d; (about 8%) which lack direct experimental cDNA or EST evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The predicted genes in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome have been mainly identified by computational methods. Experimental detection of these genes was missing; mostly because they demonstrate poor expression, weak statistical signals or less conservation across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Others found that unused genetic information can remain in the genome for many generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Reactivation of dormant genes has been used for the treatment of particular disorders indicating that the silenced genes can have essential functions in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These studies provide evidence that dormant genes can be available on the genome throughout many generations and they can contain essential genetic information. Thus, we entertain the possibility that these predicted genes simply need a trigger to activate their expression, and this trigger may be elicited when animals are exposed to certain environmental stimuli.</p><p id="Par41">A better understanding of the biological systems can be achieved through mining publicly available data sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We expanded our knowledge in the affected genetic systems by acquiring the ncRNA profiles from WormBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Condition-specific expression of ncRNAs implies important regulatory functions for these molecules in adaptive responses. Earlier studies have identified various classes of ncRNAs and their roles in biological systems including RNA splicing, DNA replication, epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and X-chromosome inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, the majority of predicted ncRNAs have properties or functions that have not been identified yet. The list of unclassified ncRNAs, or &#x0201c;ncRNAs,&#x0201d; employed in this study was derived from the &#x02018;7&#x000a0;k-set&#x02019; that was generated by the modENCODE Consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The &#x02018;7&#x000a0;k-set&#x02019; was assembled via predictions based on conservation and RNA secondary structure, and therefore, functional genomic studies of these &#x0201c;ncRNAs&#x0201d; are also still lacking. The co-enrichment of the ncRNA expressions with the coding ones suggest an interplay between these two.</p><p id="Par42">In our RNA-seq experiments, we used poly(A) selection method but still observed numerous ncRNA molecules potentially because many eukaryotic ncRNAs are polyadenylated. For example, a poly(A) tail is part of the mature RNA for many long ncRNAs, i.e., <italic>Xist</italic> that mediates X-chromosome inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. We cannot rule out that the ncRNAs sampled in our study resulted from technical artifacts in the RNA-seq. Nevertheless, many ncRNAs had expression levels higher than the housekeeping gene <italic>pmp-3</italic>. These findings would seem to suggest that the sampling of these RNAs was not an artifact of RNA-seq<italic>.</italic> The inclusion of non-polyadenylated ncRNA molecules can bring more insights for understanding the ncRNA functions in adaptive responses.</p><p id="Par43">Along with the phenotypical differences, there were considerable differences in RNA expressions between the N2 and AB1 strains which were cultured in the same growth conditions. N2 had been reported to exhibit innate immune response against pathogenic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, previous studies have determined that the N2 and wild-isolate CB4856 strains display a high variation in gene expressions and many of these strain-specific variations are related to innate immunity genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Similarly, our GO analysis results showed enrichment in innate immune response for the genes expressed exclusively in the AB1 strain on OP50 NGM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These genes do not correspond to the previously reported divergent regions between the strains which might have caused the differences in gene expressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The AB1 animals are challenged more with pathogens in their natural habitat. The AB1-specific expression of innate immune response genes may indicate that the expression of these genes are more readily available in the AB1 strain than N2 to prepare the animals for a potential pathogen encounter. The results seem to suggest that <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the wild have the natural aptitude to survive not only on different food sources but also many other environmental variables including pathogens or the shifts between the solid and liquid settings. However, years of laboratory domestication of the N2 strain may have given rise to laboratory selections or genetic bottlenecks that may have hindered the ability of the N2 animals to acclimate to changing environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Alternatively, a potential presence of cis- and trans- eQTL between N2 and AB1 can be the underlying reason for the differences in the enrichment of innate response genes. Follow-up experiments are needed to determine the underlying reason for the expression differences in the innate immunity genes between N2 and the wild-isolates AB1 and CB4856.</p><p id="Par44">For the majority of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> studies, the worms are cultured on bacteria-seeded agar plates instead of an axenic medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, a bacterial food source can present confounding effects on certain studies. For example, bacterial by-products can create genetic responses in the animals, and these responses are often overlooked. Axenic media is desirable in space, biochemical, and toxicology studies as it enables automated culturing and experimentation, and it eliminates the potential contamination risks due to a bacterial diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].

To distinguish whether the genetic responses are from the case study or the axenic media conditions, a separate investigation should be conducted.

Worms were destained in PBST, washed three times with M9 and mounted on a 2% agarose pad for microscopy. All micrographs were taken with the Zeiss 710 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40&#x000d7;/1.2&#x000a0;N.A. water immersion objective. Dissected gonads were stained with SYBR gold as mentioned above. Nematodes were placed onto 0.22&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M filters where the excess liquid was removed to visualize cuticular structures via cryo-SEM. Upon attaching the filter paper onto the sample holder, samples were plunged into liquid nitrogen slush. There a vacuum was pulled allowing sample transfer to the Gatan Alto 2500 cryo chamber at a temperature of &#x02212;&#x02009;125&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Samples were sublimated for 10&#x000a0;min at 90&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C followed by cooling to &#x02212;&#x02009;125&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. A thin layer of Gold Palladium was sputtered onto the samples. The samples were then transferred into a Hitachi S-4700 Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope for imaging. At least 20 animals were screened for each phenotype, and the represented figures were used for the observed phenotypes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
