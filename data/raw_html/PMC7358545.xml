Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive allele of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana SCD1</italic> (<italic>stomatal cytokinesis defective1</italic>) that encodes a RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of the <italic>scd1-1</italic> mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25&#x000b0;C, but not at the permissive temperature of 18&#x000b0;C. In <italic>scd1-1</italic> at 25&#x000b0;C, PIN1- and PIN2-GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25&#x000b0;C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. The endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2-GFP in <italic>scd1-1</italic> exhibited FM4-64 signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SCD1</kwd><kwd>gravitropism</kwd><kwd>lateral root</kwd><kwd>auxin transport</kwd><kwd>PIN2</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Aeronautics and Space Administration<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000104</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">National Science Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000001</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="73"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The process of auxin transport drives many aspects of plant development, including primary root elongation, lateral root development, and asymmetric growth in response to gravity and light gradients (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Muday and DeLong, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Vieten et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Zazimalova et al., 2010</xref>). Auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) is transported long distances in two polarities in two root cell layers (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Muday and DeLong, 2001</xref>). Cell to cell IAA transport is mediated by AUX/LAX influx carriers and by efflux carriers of the PIN and ABCB families (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Zazimalova et al., 2010</xref>). Directionality is controlled by asymmetric localization of PIN proteins at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Wisniewska et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adamowski and Friml, 2015</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots, PIN1 is localized to the stele and implicated in auxin transport toward the root apex (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Galweiler et al., 1998</xref>), which is now called rootward transport and this auxin flow is required for lateral root development (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lavenus et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, PIN2 is localized to the epidermal and cortical cell layers of roots and mediates shootward transport from the root apex (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 1998</xref>), which is integral to root elongation and gravitropism (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Rashotte et al., 2000</xref>). PIN3 is localized to the columella cells at the root tip, where the angle of the gravity vector is perceived, and in the vascular cylinder, consistent with functions in gravitropism and root development, respectively (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Friml et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Harrison and Masson, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The polar distribution of the PIN proteins is dynamic (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Weller et al., 2017</xref>). Targeting of PIN proteins to the membrane in response to stimuli may be an important mechanism to allow changes in auxin transport and dependent growth processes (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Paciorek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014</xref>). PIN proteins travel through the endosome to the plasma membrane after <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis through a highly regulated process (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Jasik et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) involving the RAB and ARF families of small G proteins. GNOM, a well-studied ARF-GEF and target of the drug Brefeldin A, is critical in targeting of PIN1 and PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Geldner et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Although genetic approaches have identified pathways for targeting PIN proteins (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adamowski and Friml, 2015</xref>), non-conditional mutants with impaired auxin transport, such as <italic>gnom</italic>, have profound developmental phenotypes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Geldner et al., 2003</xref>). This complicates determination of whether altered auxin transport causes developmental phenotypes or the converse.</p><p>This study used a conditional <italic>scd1-1</italic> mutant to test whether auxin transport trafficking defects precede growth or developmental phenotypes. The SCD1 protein has a DENN domain, found exclusively in RAB-GEFs (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Marat et al., 2011</xref>). SCD1 and an associated protein, SCD2, have been shown to complex with a RabE1 at the exocyst in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Mayers et al., 2017</xref>), where it plays a role in exocytosis and recycling of membrane proteins. Three <italic>scd1</italic> mutant alleles have been described: <italic>scd1-1</italic>, <italic>scd1-2</italic>, and <italic>scd1-3</italic> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Falbel et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>scd1-2</italic> and <italic>scd1-3</italic> are loss of function mutants with altered guard cell development, and profound root growth and developmental phenotypes. However, the temperature sensitive <italic>scd1-1</italic> allele, displays these phenotypes only at the restrictive temperature of 25&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Falbel et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>This study utilizes the unique features of a temperature sensitive <italic>scd1-1</italic> mutant allele to demonstrate that the growth and developmental effects in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots at the restrictive temperature are tied to altered auxin transport protein targeting. The developmental and auxin transport defects can be induced by transition to the restrictive temperature and reversed by return to the permissive temperature. We report the effects of these treatments on polar auxin transport and dependent physiological processes including lateral root development, gravity response, and root elongation. At the restrictive temperature, PIN2 fused to GFP accumulates in endomembrane vesicles in <italic>scd1</italic>-1, which is consistent with a role of SCD1 in controlling PIN endomembrane targeting. Auxin transport and endomembrane accumulation of a PIN2 reporter were examined both in <italic>scd1-1</italic> grown continuously at the restrictive temperature or in seedlings transitioned briefly to this temperature. The endomembrane bodies in which the PIN2 fusion protein is localized also accumulate other proteins that are linked to the late multivesicular endosome and the endosome dye FM4-64 after an extended incubation. These results provide support for the hypothesis that SCD1 protein functions to regulate the movement of PIN2 to and from the plasma membrane and that these transient changes in localization occur more rapidly than changes in auxin transport and dependent developmental processes.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Root Elongation and Lateral Root Development Are Temperature-Sensitive in <italic>scd1-1</italic></title><p>If <italic>scd1-1</italic> has a defect in targeting of auxin transport proteins, then alterations in auxin transport-dependent root responses, including primary root elongation, gravitropism, and lateral root development, would be expected.

Our ability to reversibly alter auxin transport by turning off or on SCD1 function support the model of an auxin pulse that drives root formation that occurs within a precise developmental window.</p><p>The effects of the <italic>scd1-1</italic> mutation on auxin transport and gravitropism were evident after both long and short-term exposure to the non-permissive temperature, with changes in auxin transport evident preceding gravitropic differences. When grown continuously at 25&#x000b0;C or within 8 h after transfer from the permissive 18&#x000b0;C temperature, <italic>scd1-1</italic> seedlings showed reduced shootward <sup>3</sup>H-IAA transport and accumulation of auxin-induced gene expression at the root tip, consistent with impaired auxin transport away from the site of application. Similarly, continuous growth at 25&#x000b0;C or a shift from 18 to 25&#x000b0;C for 8 h showed a significant decrease in the gravitropic curvature in <italic>scd1-1</italic> compared to wild type. Auxin-induced gene expression, visualized via DR5-GFP fluorescence (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Muday and Rahman, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Geisler et al., 2014</xref>) was rapidly enhanced on the lower side of Col(g) roots after gravitropic reorientation, but was impaired in <italic>scd1-1</italic> seedlings relative to wild type only in plants grown at 25&#x000b0;C. These data support the hypothesis that a functional SCD1 protein is needed to maintain polar and lateral auxin transport and the physiological processes dependent upon dynamic changes in appropriate auxin distribution. Consistent with this model, altered PIN2-GFP trafficking is even more rapidly perturbed in <italic>scd1-1</italic> than auxin movements and gravity response.</p><p>Because PIN2 is required for rootward transport and root gravitropism (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Rashotte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2002</xref>), we compared its localization in the <italic>scd1-1</italic> mutant and wild type using a PIN2-GFP reporter. At 25&#x000b0;C, PIN2 is normally localized to the plasma membrane on the shootward end of cells of the lateral root cap and epidermis of the developing root of wild type seedlings (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 1998</xref>). In the <italic>scd1-1</italic> mutant, PIN2-GFP was not restricted to the plasma membrane but was also localized in endomembrane bodies. <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Mayers et al. (2017)</xref> showed that <italic>scd1-2</italic> has altered PIN2-GFP trafficking during treatment with brefeldin A, a drug which blocks intracellular endosome and trans-Golgi transport. However, we find that in <italic>scd1-1</italic> at the restrictive temperature, PIN2-GFP accumulates in the absence of BFA.</p><p>The trafficking defect is not detectable in <italic>scd1-1</italic> roots grown at 18&#x000b0;C, but when switched from 18 to 25&#x000b0;C, the PIN2 trafficking defect becomes apparent within minutes. Since changes in auxin transport and root growth and development are not observed for 8&#x02013;12 h, this suggests that these responses are sequential and that PIN mislocalization is not a secondary result of compromised root development at 25&#x000b0;C. The linkage is most evident in terms of gravity response. PIN2 controls shootward auxin transport that is required for gravitropism (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Rashotte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Upon transition of <italic>scd1-1</italic> to the non-permissive temperature, PIN2-GFP endomembrane accumulation is evident with less than hour. In Col(g) a transition from 18 to 25&#x000b0;C increases shootward transport by more than fivefold within 5 h, leading to a more than twofold greater transport in Col(g) than in <italic>scd1-1</italic>. Treatment of roots for 12 h at the non-permissive temperature impaired gravity response in <italic>scd1-1</italic> to levels consistent with constitutive growth at this non-permissive temperature. Together these results support the timeline where PIN2 targeting is impaired, reducing auxin transport and then dependent physiological processes.</p><p>We also detected l PIN1-GFP within endomembrane bodies in <italic>scd1-1</italic>. However, other fluorescent fusions to the auxin transport proteins PIN3, ABCB19, and AUX1, were not observed in any endomembrane compartments. As all of these proteins are trafficked and recycled, and the <italic>scd1-1</italic> mutation most strongly affects PIN1 and PIN2 and dependent physiological processes, there appears to be selectivity of SCD1 targets toward PIN2 and PIN1, which is consistent with other studies that reveal distinct regulatory and trafficking machinery between auxin transporters (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Weller et al., 2017</xref>). Other reports have indicated that ABCB19 and AUX1 localization are regulated by different trafficking mechanisms than those that regulate PIN1 and PIN2 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Kleine-Vehn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Titapiwatanakun et al., 2008</xref>). The results are based on differences in the trafficking of these proteins in response to brefeldin A and FM4-64 uptake (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Titapiwatanakun et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We find that in <italic>scd1-1</italic> at 25&#x000b0;C, PIN2-GFP accumulates in the late or multivesicular endosome. Impaired uptake of the endosomal marker dye FM4-64 has previously been observed in <italic>scd1-1</italic>, suggesting that SCD1 participates in endocytosis via clathrin coated vesicles (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">McMichael et al., 2013</xref>). To determine whether FM4-64 accumulates in the PIN2 endomembrane bodies observed here, the roots of <italic>scd1-1</italic> containing PIN2-GFP grown at 18&#x000b0;C and transferred to 25&#x000b0;C were treated with FM4-64. Although initially there was little co-localization, within 20 min significant overlap was observed. These results are consistent with PIN2 being trapped in <italic>scd1</italic> mutants in a late or multivesicular endosome or pre-vacuolar compartment on its way to or from the plasma membrane through the endosome.</p><p>To confirm that the endomembranes in which PIN2-GFP accumulates in <italic>scd1-1</italic> are late endosomes, we crossed multiple endosomal markers into this mutant and performed colocalization analyses. In <italic>scd1-1</italic> at 25&#x000b0;C, but not 18&#x000b0;C, we observed PIN2-GFP colocalization with ARA7 and to a lesser extent with ARA6. ARA6 and ARA7 are RAB5 GTPases contained in late multivesicular endosomes, with related, but not identical trafficking activities (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Ueda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Ebine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Paez Valencia et al., 2016</xref>). ARA7 function is required for vesicle transport between the pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) and the vacuole (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Haas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2013</xref>) and ARA6 is associated with transport between the PVC and the plasma membrane, where it may regulate trafficking from the endosome to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Ebine et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). PIN2 has also been localized to ARA7 vesicles in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots after treatment with endosidin 16, which inhibits apical membrane trafficking (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The colocalization of PIN2 with both ARA7 and ARA6 Rab-related GTPases is not surprising considering that compartments bearing ARA7 and ARA6 have been previously shown to partially overlap, despite evidence that they are distinct endosomal compartments (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Ueda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Ebine et al., 2012</xref>). The PVC, where both ARA6 and ARA7 are found, is a distinct organelle in plants that facilitates the transport of materials from the endosomes to the vacuole (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Contento and Bassham, 2012</xref>). Using immunogold and confocal microscopy, plasma membrane proteins that pass through the PVC have been shown to be directed to the vacuole for degradation (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Haas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Viotti et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, association of PIN2 with the PVC in <italic>scd1-1</italic> suggests that PIN2 in the PVC is likely targeted to the vacuole for degradation. This could explain the reduced domain of PIN2-GFP staining seen in the mutants at the restrictive temperature, coincident with the changes in columella cells. However, there is also evidence that suggests that PIN2 can be retrieved from the PVC and recycled (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Spitzer et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, PIN1, PIN2, and AUX1 are targeted to the vacuole through the multi-vesicular body (MVB), and RabF2A co-localizes in the MVB with PIN1-GFP (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Spitzer et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The localization of PIN2-GFP in late endosomal compartments in <italic>scd1-1</italic> is consistent with reports that PIN protein turnover involves both cycling between the endosome and plasma membrane and vacuolar degradation, depending on environmental conditions (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Paciorek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Grunewald and Friml, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Jasik et al., 2013</xref>). For example, when roots are reoriented relative to the gravity vector, enhanced endocytosis of PIN2 at the apical membrane followed by degradation through sorting to a proteolytic endosomal compartment resulted in asymmetric distribution of PIN2, redirected auxin flow, and root bending (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abas et al., 2006</xref>). The mis-localization and loss of membrane PIN2 in <italic>scd1-1</italic> explains the observed reductions in auxin transport and the observed phenotypes.</p><p>The efficient targeting of auxin transport proteins to the plasma membrane is required for appropriate auxin transport and dependent physiological processes. In this paper we have shown that the conditional <italic>scd1-1</italic> mutant, with a defect in a gene that functions as a RAB-GEF (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Mayers et al., 2017</xref>), has altered localization of PIN2, with accumulation of this protein in endomembrane bodies. The PIN2-GFP containing endomembrane bodies in <italic>scd1-1</italic> showed dye accumulation and fluorescent protein reporter expression consistent with a late endosomal/prevacuolar character. Consistent with this altered protein localization, polar auxin transport and gravity response are impaired in <italic>scd1-1</italic>. The kinetics of the alterations in these responses upon transition to the non-permissive temperature demonstrate that altered trafficking of PIN2 is observed within minutes of transition to this temperature, while auxin transport and gravity defects are measured hours later, and root developmental defects can be quantified days after transition. These findings provide direct evidence that disruption of the targeting machinery which disrupts PIN2 protein localization precedes reductions in auxin transport and changes in auxin transport-dependent physiological processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S4.SS1"><title>Growth of Mutant and Transgenic Seedlings</title><p>Seeds were sterilized (75% ethanol, 0.01% Triton X-100) for 2 min, followed by a 95% ethanol rinse.
