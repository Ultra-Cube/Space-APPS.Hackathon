Despite this, there is much to learn about how humans adapt to the unique challenges of the space environment. The space environment includes unique stressors, such as microgravity (e.g. weightlessness), immune system perturbations, and space radiation exposure. Determining the effects of spaceflight on the human genome is imperative to support long-term human presence in space. Additionally, a host of physiological adaptations occur when humans travel into space, ranging from cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning, vision changes (e.g. spaceflight associated neuro ocular syndrome), immune suppression, and metabolic changes, among others [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, increasing evidence highlights the systemic immune dysregulation crewmembers experience from spaceflight exposure. Indeed, there appears to be a reduction in T cell frequency, suppressed cytotoxic function, as well as fluctuations in cytokine concentrations, with increased expression of TNF-<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic>, interleukin-8, interleukin-1ra, thrombopoietin, VEGF, and various chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CXCL5, etc.) associated with spaceflight [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>To date, almost all space missions have been led by professional astronauts from government space programs. More recently, however, SpaceX launched a crew of four civilian astronauts on the Inspiration4 (I4) mission, marking a new era for human space exploration. The present I4 mission study aims to investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on civilians, along with the post-flight and long-term biomedical, immunologic, and genetic alterations resulting from spaceflight. This includes rapid telomeric responses, whereby telomere elongation occurs as a function of spaceflight, followed by shortening upon return to Earth [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Both unusually short and long telomeres have been associated with adverse health effects involving aging and age-related pathologies, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Furthermore, a variety of lifestyle factors and environmental exposures influence telomere length. Previous studies have also shown changes in clonal hematopoiesis, where a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) gain a clonal advantage through the acquisition of somatic mutations. Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with cardiovascular disease, the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and increased overall mortality [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The NASA Twins Study shed light on telomeric responses and the chronic inflammatory state resulting from long-duration spaceflight and provided the first measures of telomere length and clonal hematopoiesis in astronauts [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Mutations in epigenetic regulators, such as DNMT3A and TET2, were found at increased rates in both career astronaut twins when compared to their civilian counterparts.

Our findings, including telomere length dynamics, CHIP-related clonal expansion, WGS genomic stability, cfDNA cell lysis analysis, and immune cell longitudinal gene expression profiling, broadly contextualize the physiological burdens of short duration spaceflight. This study adds key CHIP and genetic data on astronauts, which are limited, and can serve as a reference for future spaceflight planning, short missions around Earth's orbit, and longer-duration missions into deep space.</p><p>The NASA Twins Study was the first to report spaceflight-specific telomere elongation in humans, with one astronaut experiencing telomere elongation during his one-year mission, rapid telomere shortening upon return to Earth, and telomere length recovery to near pre-flight baseline values over the following months, although many more short telomeres after spaceflight than before were also observed [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Luxton et al. reported similar spaceflight-associated telomere length dynamics in 3 unrelated astronauts on &#x0223c; 6-month missions onboard the ISS [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It was hypothesized that such dramatic shifts in telomere length dynamics were associated with chronic exposure to the space radiation environment and represented an adaptive response to chronic oxidative damage, specifically to telomeres, whereby the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway is transiently activated in normal somatic cells [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Cytogenetic evidence of heterogeneous telomere lengths and DNA damage responses were also reported, and&#x02014;together with our cfDNA enrichment analyses&#x02014;suggested increased DNA damage and are consistent with space radiation exposure and increased senescence-associated foci. Similar changes in telomere length dynamics observed in the I4 crew as a function of spaceflight indicate that telomere length alterations are fast-acting as associated with spaceflight, even for missions of short (e.g. days) duration. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments, originating from various tissues and the immune system, offer a non-invasive method for assessing astronauts' dynamic immune responses to spaceflight-induced physiological stress. As an emerging biomarker, cfDNA concentration and molecular profile yield valuable insights into stress responses in unique spaceflight environments despite its heterogeneous and sensitive nature.</p><p>Our study indicates that the impact of short-duration spaceflight on cfDNA concentration in astronaut plasma is subtler than long duration missions, but increased innate and adaptive immune system activity is still apparent. Moreover, cfDNA enrichment from all immune cells persists post-flight, suggesting a delayed response involving immune cell turnover and active DNA repair mechanisms. This phenomenon warrants further investigation as it is imperative for both short and long duration spaceflight to elucidate the temporal changes to immune cell types in order to better predict and prevent future risks.</p><sec id="sec4-1"><title>Effects of short and long duration spaceflight on CHIP genomic alterations in civilian and career astronauts</title><p>In the I4 cohort, we found no relationship between spaceflight and increased CHIP-related genetic abnormalities in the scale of three months after spaceflight. With our deep sequencing targeted probe approach (Mean Depth &#x0223c;15,000x), we found putative mutations present in subject C004&#x02019;s and C003 targeted samples but not C001 and C002. DNMT3A gene mutations chr2: g.25235778C&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;G, chr2: g.25234347G&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;C, chr2: g.25241591C&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;A are all missense variants with a likely low/moderate impact on function. A frameshift mutation, chr2: g.25246732GTCGTGGCACACCGGGAACAGCTTCCCCGC&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;G, was detected in astronaut 004, as well as a stop-gain function mutation chr2: g.25247647G&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;A. Although DNMT3A presented the higher number of mutations, CHEK2 presented a missense mutation chr22: g.28734438C&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;T in C004, and ASXL1 presented a frameshift mutation chr20: g.32434638AG&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;A in both C003 and C004. However, with a VAF of&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.02 for all timepoints, although detectable, there is no evidence to suggest a clinical effect on the subjects, that is, spaceflight having no discernible effects up to 3 months post-flight. TET2 exhibited a missense mutation chr4: g.105275662G&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;T at a VAF &#x0223c; 0.3 in C003. However, putative mutations in CH-linked genes were not found at disproportionate allele frequencies post-flight, nor were <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> mutations seen in the post-flight samples.</p><p>Although our findings suggest that no pathological genomic alterations occurred as a function of spaceflight in the I4 cohort, further longitudinal tracking of the astronauts will help us discern the long-term effects, if any, of short duration missions. Previous studies of the relationship between clonal hematopoiesis and astronauts has elucidated that spaceflight increases proportion of CH abnormalities in subjects when compared to healthy controls [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is not clear why that is the case, or when in an astronaut's career these abnormalities begin to appear, a key limitation of studying career astronauts. Previous studies have also shown the influence of acute events on the development of CH abnormalities, such as first responders from the world trade center tragedy [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, the I4 mission is uniquely positioned to characterize the clonal dynamics associated with a short-duration flight, and will allow future comparisons between career astronaut CH abnormalities and civilian space travelers. There is an opportunity to study the compound effects of spaceflight between missions on CH abnormalities if one or more of the I4 astronauts returns to space. This can be leveraged for a better understanding of long-term risk and clonal evolution.</p><p>The space environment is known to be chronically inflammatory as astronauts in previous studies have reported increased inflammation markers with the flight duration [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref>]. In the NASA Twins Study, both career astronauts had increased mutational burden in epigenetic regulators such as DNMT3A and TET2 compared to prostate cancer patient controls. Although only one of the twins was in orbital spaceflight for a year, both twins displayed comparable CHIP-related mutations shortly after flight and for several years of follow-up [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We continue to monitor the CHIP-related mutational burden of both astronauts years post-flight. The VAF of mutations found in both subjects has, as expected, increased over time, and a new missense variant has been identified in subject HR in the last 3-year follow-up. This is to be expected as CHIP-mutational burden is known to increase as a function of aging. Both astronauts, however, presented clonal burdens that preceded their age-matched control for over two decades at the time of the original study. The fact that TW (space subject) did not present a greater mutational burden post-flight than HR (ground control), despite the length of his last mission, might indicate that the overall number of flights, rather than their duration, is a greater extrinsic factor for clonal positive selection. The I4 cohort provides a unique opportunity to assess the short and long term physiological effects of a singular spaceflight mission. As civilians, the I4 cohort's physiological findings are likely a better representation of what first-time fliers may expect as we gear up toward an increased human presence in space.</p><p>Moreover, the longitudinal comparison of point mutations and indels from whole-genome sequencing data supports the results of the targeted deep-sequencing CHIP panel, wherein there is not a significant increase in the genome-wide mutational burden for first-flight civilian astronauts. These results favorably indicate that short-time spaceflight does not contribute to overall increased genomic instability, at least on a timescale of several months post-flight. Extending the analysis to future missions and continuous longitudinal tracking for years post-flight could shed more light on the long-term consequences of spaceflight in relation to its altitude and duration, or for low VAF alleles, as well as repeated exposure of astronauts to space radiation.</p><p>Finally, we note that transient changes in mitochondrial gene expression were seen as a response to spaceflight across a broad range of immune cells within the I4 cohort. Longitudinal gene expression analyses revealed a conserved trend across both adaptive and innate immune cells that had not been described before in the spaceflight literature. In comparisons between L-92 vs R&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1 and R&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1 vs R&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;82 all immune cell types demonstrated increased expression of <italic toggle="yes">MTRNRL12, MTRNR2L8</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MT-ND4L</italic> in R&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1. <italic toggle="yes">MTRNRL12</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MTRNR2L8</italic> are pseudogenes thought to be involved in negative regulation of the execution phase of apoptosis [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As such, increased <italic toggle="yes">MTRNRL12 &#x00026; MTRNR2L8</italic> expression could indicate a physiological attempt at regulating increased immune cell death. Increased immune cell apoptosis was seen in our cfDNA analysis, at all post-flight timepoints, providing support to the gene expression alterations seen.</p><p>Of note, <italic toggle="yes">MT-CO2 and MT-CO3</italic> gene expression were downregulated post-flight (R&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1) compared to pre-flight (L-92) within CD86+&#x000a0;DCs, NCAM+&#x000a0;NK cells, CD14+&#x000a0;monocytes, and CD3 delta+&#x000a0;CD8+ &#x00026; CD4+&#x000a0;T cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref> &#x00026; s<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">upplememtary Fig. S4</xref>B, D, F,&#x000a0;H). <italic toggle="yes">MT-CO2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MT-CO3</italic> encode subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, which is involved in the reduction of oxygen to water.

Most mitochondrial genes return to basal levels of expression in our L-92 vs R&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;82 comparison, suggesting relief from spaceflight-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress. DCs, monocytes, and T cells showed increased <italic toggle="yes">MT-ND4L</italic> expression over two months after return from flight. The <italic toggle="yes">MT-ND4L</italic> gene encodes for NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4L, a component of the respiratory chain Complex I, a protein required for electron transfer and dehydrogenation from NADH to ubiquinone. Longitudinal changes in its gene expression may suggest that mitochondrial ATP production is altered long after return to earth. However, whether the gene expression is representative of decreased activity of the electron transport chain or if it is a physiological response seeking to restore mitochondrial function due to the hypofunctional aberrant effects of oxidative stress, remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In the spaceflight literature, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes had increased expression of genes related to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, mitochondrial transit peptide, mitochondrial translocation, and mitoribosomes [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The NASA Twins Study also revealed transient enrichment of mitochondrial signaling that returned to baseline in the recovery period [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our findings, in contrast, reveal a more complex picture of mitochondrial gene expression changes where some are consistently upregulated across cell types and others are transiently downregulated in R&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1 but return to basal levels in R&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;82.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2"><title>Immune adaptations to short duration spaceflight</title><p>Immune system dysregulation in crewmembers following spaceflight has been consistently reported, revealing adaptive immune system changes and general shifts towards a Th2 T cell phenotype [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Short-term exposure to spaceflight conditions may affect innate immune system components, including functional alterations of key immune cell populations like CD14+&#x000a0;monocytes and dendritic cells. Microgravity-induced changes can result in decreased neutrophil and macrophage phagocytic activity, thus affecting the initial response to pathogens. Moreover, microgravity may alter monocyte maturation and function, which play a critical role in antigen presentation and T cell activation. Kaur et al. (2005) describe that, although the percentage of CD14+&#x000a0;monocytes was not significantly reduced in astronauts following spaceflight, days after landing, the ability of these cells to engulf pathogens, degranulate, and mount an immune response was reduced compared to that of ground controls [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

Additional studies are needed across varying cell types, mission duration, and crew background, which can also help guide countermeasures.</p><p>Of note, the short-duration space shuttle studies revealed decreased lymphocyte response, post-flight neutrophil increase, and eosinophil decrease, correlating with in-flight stress rather than microgravity [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].
